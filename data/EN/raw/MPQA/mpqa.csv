1,"He was followed by Division General Rafael Damiani, from the militarized National Guard (GN), who condemned the fact that President Chavez ordered troops to use force in putting down a demonstration in Caracas in support of the striking managers of the state-owned PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.]."
1,"""At this point, the military would have to intervene, either pressuring both sides into a real agreement or opting for an unconstitutional way out (a coup),"" he predicted."
1,"The national strike is an important battle in the long-range war whose final result is not shaping up as a romance,"" he said."
1,"Opponents of the president who assembled this Wednesday in one of the offices of the state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum (PDVSA), joining the strike waged by its executives since Thursday [4 April], are carrying signs appealing for support for the men in uniform."
1,"The analyst observed that ""Venezuela is now radicalized between an inept, abusive and authoritarian government and a neutralized, heterogeneous, impatient and politically immature opposition."""
0,"On Tuesday, the inspector general of the Armed Forces, General Lucas Rincon, accompanied Civil Defense Minister Jose Vicente Rangel and Energy Minister Alvaro Silva Calderon in a tour of the strategic oil facilities of the state-owned PDVSA, whose managers are completing their seventh day of the strike that paralyzed refining operations and shipments of fuel."
1,"Following their tour, Rincon supported the official report by stating that ""the supply of oil to the main national and international markets (this country\'s main source of foreign exchange) is normal and meets existing agreements."""
1,"General Gonzalez, who reviewed the Venezuelan-Colombian border conflict, accused Chavez of lying when he stated that the Colombian guerrillas are not entering Venezuelan territory and contradicted him: They are indeed entering and ""have been fought militarily"" by troops from this country."
1,"""Soldiers, where are you?"""" and ""Soldier, support us,"" read some of the posters carried by the strike sympathizers."
1,"""The conflict will intensify in time."
1,"Leon added that the opposition has viewed the PDVSA conflict as ""the perfect lifesaver for reviving civilian social pressure for Chavez\' ouster from power, this following a cooling"" of such pressure in recent days."
0,"At the same time, security at oil facilities at bases of operations and in administrative areas of Caracas has been stepped up, it was reported."

0,"Luis Alberto Camacho, deputy minister of citizen security, reported that 22,000 members of the National Guard, one of the components of the Armed Forces, have been deployed throughout the country in order to safeguard individuals and property during the general strike."
1,The alternative of a state of emergency was explicitly ruled out this Wednesday by Interior Minister Ramon Rodriguez Chacin.
1,"The analyst noted that although there is growing unrest in the streets, the opposition\'s hope of the immediate exit of the chief of state ""looks presumptuous."""
1,"Army Brigadier General Nestor Gonzalez, who commands no troops, appeared at a press conference on Wednesday and made pronouncements against the chief of state, joining five other dissident officers on active duty who rebelled in February."
1,"""With the guerrillas in particular, we supply the dead, while you enjoy politics,"" Gonzalez said, the first of the military officials to rebel on Wednesday."
1,"Leon visualizes two scenarios: In the first, tension will increase in the days ahead, but not destabilize the government, then dwindle toward the end of the week and generate frustration among the opposition over not achieving its objective, a factor that would in turn strengthen Chavez."
1,"He further noted that the ""possibilities of negotiation between these two groups are becoming nonexistent."
1,"Speaking in his turn, Army Commander Efrain Vasquez and General Francisco Belisario Landis, commanding officer of the GN, affirmed that their forces are participating in the Armed Forces' plans of alert and denied that there is any militarization of the facilities of the state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum (PDVSA)."
1,"However, Datanalisis analyst Leon indicated that even though Chavez still controls the military forces at the present time, this fact ""constitutes no permanent life insurance,"" since the current indefinite general strike called by the opposition CTV and the FEDECAMARAS [Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry] leadership is only one battle in a war that he predicts will be a long one."
1,"The second, ""not to be dismissed,"" he said, is that Chavez will remain strong in his position vis-a-vis his opponents and declare a state of emergency with the suspension of guarantees, the people would declare themselves in a state of civil disobedience, and uncontrolled violence would be unleashed."
1,"However, the high military commands supported the government during the emergency caused by the strike staged by the trade union and business association opposition, a strike that was extended indefinitely on Wednesday night, according to Carlos Ortega, president of the Venezuelan Workers Confederation (CTV), the largest labor confederation in the country."
1,"Damiani, an official on active duty, said he had revealed the information in order to try to impede ""this action resulting from a presidential folly that will sully the name of the Armed Forces and especially the National Guard."""
1,"The second rebel, GN Div Gen Damiani, accused Chavez of having ""ordered the National Guard to use force for the purpose of removing individuals positioned"" in front of one of the PDVSA buildings in Chuao in this capital."
1,"Caracas (AFP) -- The Venezuelan Military High Command maintains its support for President Hugo Chavez despite calls from the opposition to take part in an indefinite general strike declared Wednesday night [10 April], and despite the individual acts of insubordination of two generals on that same day, one of them in command of no troops."
1,The current summit will hopefully allow the CIS countries to lay new ways towards rapprochement.
1,"""We cannot stand on the sidelines of this global tendency,"" the Kazakh president said."
1,"He said, however, that a real unification will take place after all, since the CIS countries have far more reasons for a union that the European Union countries."
1,Kazakh president optimistic about future of CIS
1,"Moscow, 29 November: Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has arrived in Moscow to attend the 10th anniversary summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said upon his arrival on Thursday [29 November] that ""certain apathy"" to the commonwealth has developed in the CIS member countries."
1,"Concerning the delimitation of the border between Kazakhstan and Russia, Nazarbayev said that this process is continuing without any disagreements and with mutual respect for each other's interests, and that documents on the final delimitation are likely to be signed next year."

1,The exclusion of China from the recall has led to claims that the firm was biased against Chinese customers.

1,The visit is aimed at strengthening military relations between the two countries.
0,Nyanda is scheduled to return after a week and he will then immediately travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
1,He also has a quality deemed necessary for exercising his office in the current crisis: political flexibility.
1,"Fernando Henrique was heard ""with interest and attention,"" as they say in diplomatic jargon, but he did not move the group."
0,"The Argentine question was raised by the president of the Swedish Trade Council, Ulf Dinkenspiel."
0,"After favorably describing Duhalde, the president asked for understanding and support for his Government."
1,"However, that is likely just an aggravating factor in the crisis: the politicians who are running the Argentine process are almost exclusively from Buenos Aires or the province of Buenos Aires, like Governor Carlos Ruckauf."
1,"One of the businessmen present told Valor that the uncertainties in relation to Argentina involve not only the future, but mainly the country's present."
1,"In his appraisal, the solution will demand many sacrifices by the elites and by the people, a true restructuring of the national compact."
1,President Fernando Henrique Cardoso made a harsh appraisal of the situation in Argentina in a private conversation with a group of Swedish businessmen last Friday in Stockholm.
1,"He said that, in face of the economic and government paralysis, it is not possible to rule out the risk of a breakdown in the nation's institutions."
1,"""We simply do not understand what is going on there,"" the businessman summarized."
1,"He said he believed that the risk of contagion in the region has been overcome, but he asked President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was in Argentina before traveling to Europe, for a more complete evaluation."
1,"The Brazilian president said that a solution for Argentina, even over a longer term, is not a sure thing, due to the institutional risk."
1,"That restructuring has to go beyond the relations between the provinces and the central government, a traditional question in Argentina, the president said."
1,"""There is concern over a degeneration of the democratic process in Argentina,"" the president stated, according to two of the meeting\'s participants."
1,"According to Fernando Henrique, President Eduardo Duhalde has ""quite a sharp insight"" into the scope of the crisis."
1,"Thinking of building a Great Wall of China in the Middle East, replete with elaborate fences and tunnels, is conceding that Israel is not safe, not a normal country."
1,Sharon has ensured that Israelis are rapidly absorbing the lesson that no place in Israel can be considered safe.
1,The only way out of the current spiral of violence is for Israel to limit itself to areas within which it can assume responsibility for its citizens' security.
1,"Practically speaking, a buffer zone will be near impossible to erect."
1,Unilateral separation without a negotiated agreement could be realized - only if Israel is willing to uproot around 100 settlements.
1,"The buffer zones that Ariel Sharon intends to establish are an explicit admission that Israelis can no longer live by the sword, that the occupation is not working, and Israeli reprisals are not meeting with success."
1,"A total disengagement from the Palestinians, complete with walls and razor wire, might provide Israel its long-desired security and might free it of the burden of trying to control seven million desperate Palestinians, any number of whom are willing to die in order to end the occupation."
1,"It cannot integrate itself into the region, it is an alien seedling and, thus, it is better to isolate and fortify itself as a lowly outpost."
1,Sharon has not brought the Israeli public security.
1,But Israel has not once deigned to propose that the Palestinians live with the Israelis as full citizens in the same sate.
1,Israelis do not wonder any longer how to get along with Palestinians but how to avoid the need for it.
1,"By a margin of 2-1, Israelis think Sharon has no plan to end the violence and the buffer idea buttresses this long-standing view."
1,"With grim determination, he has destroyed the peace process and the Oslo agreements."
1,Then there is the eventual goal of the peace process: the coexistence of Israel with the state of Palestine.
1,"Israel does not want the Palestinians to be part of the same country, or have one of their own."
1,But separation will not mean an end to the occupation and no Israeli government can provide security as long as it persists in its efforts to maintain its presence beyond Israel's pre-1967 borders and to retain territories inhabited by millions of Palestinians.
1,Sharon says flatly he will not withdraw from a single settlement.
1,A wall and miles of fences is not the best of solutions.
1,Does anybody believe that the intifada can end as long as Israel persists in the occupation of the territories and Palestinians are willing to die in large numbers to deny Israel that privilege?
1,He thinks that every settlement is important and is determined that Israelis must retain as much land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as possible.
1,And now he doggedly continues to demolish and prevent any hope of a road to peaceful coexistence.
1,This means a return to Israel's pre-1967 borders.
1,"By now, it should be clear to everyone that retaliating against every act of Palestinian resistance with Israel's superior ability to punish Palestinians does not provide the security that Israelis are demanding."
1,A physical border between Israel and a new Palestinian state will be twisted and distorted to accommodate Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza.
1,"Dismissing the EU move last week, President Mugabe said Zimbabwe would withstand the sanctions imposed by Britain and its allies and would never abandon the land issue."
1,"""The United States believes that targeted travel restrictions against those who are responsible for Zimbabwe\'s crisis will advance positive change by signalling our support for the democratic forces in Zimbabwe and focusing international scrutiny on the appropriate actors,"" the US embassy said."
1,"The move follows the European Union's decision last Monday to impose sanctions on Cde Mugabe, Cabinet ministers, senior Government and military officials, including a freeze on their alleged overseas assets and a travel ban to the 15-nation bloc."
1,West aims 'to prop up MDC
1,"""They are saying that they are placing sanctions on leaders so that they don\'t come to Europe."
1,"Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa and the Organisation of African Unity lambasted the EU."
1,Namibia said Zimbabwe had the right to invite observers for its elections.
1,"The EU decision was roundly condemned by African countries, which described the move as neo-colonial."
1,"""This is neo-colonialism and economic colonialism."
1,"In a show of solidarity with Zimbabwe, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said African countries should not let themselves be manipulated by the EU and other powerful nations."
1,"I\'m saying this because some are beginning to forget that it was in Berlin where they had gone to decide on the Balkanisation of this continent into countries which they later came to colonise."""
1,"We can visit other countries in Asia and Africa,"" he said at a rally in Nkayi."
1,"However, the Government has said the sanctions are meant to prop up the opposition MDC ahead of next month's presidential election."
1,"The US embassy said the sanctions also applied to those who ""formulate, implement, or benefit from policies that undermine or injure Zimbabwe\'s democratic institutions or impede the functioning of a multi-party democracy."
1,It said there was no justification in the EU's move and the body should not regard itself as more competent than others in election observation.
1,Foreign Affairs Secretary Mr Willard Chiwewe said the West was in a hurry to prop up the MDC.
1,"""What will I be wanting in Europe?"
1,"Herald Reporter - THE United States has imposed targeted sanctions on President Mugabe and other senior Government officials for the alleged deteriorating political situation in the country, the US embassy said at the weekend."
0,"In a statement yesterday, the US embassy said the travel ban has been imposed on the President, senior Government officials, ""certain persons"" with business dealings with Zimbabwe Government officials and their families."
1,"Some $76 billion of the $132 billion debt is accounted for by foreign loans, which were lavished on Argentina."
1,"Because of the misguided policies of Argentina's politicians, Argentina is in a state of stagnation for a fourth consecutive years."
1,Foreign debts are around $132 billion and poverty is dominating the country like a dangerous virus.
1,The main problem that caused the recent shock is also a result of the restrictive economic policies that have been adopted on the advice of IMF experts.
0,"In the heat of crisis, the interim government has introduced new initiatives."
0,"This country has attracted a large amount of foreign investment by international companies, from the American continent to Europe."
1,Another important point is Argentina's connections with the global economy.
1,"What is clear is that Argentina's paralyzed economy was unable to tolerate the government's hardline policies, which finally resulted in the situation that we are witnessing today."
1,"Although IMF officials deny any connection their policies and the current situation, reports indicate that now an IMF executive delegation is actively making changes to Argentina's economy."
1,"Riots and widespread strikes, attacks on government buildings, and the plundering of stores have left scores of dead and casualties."
1,"Incidentally, the riots also occurred following the IMF's announcement of Argentina's debts."
1,"3 -- Finally, what fate awaits Argentina's crisis-stricken economy?"
1,Public dissatisfaction and an increase in the people's anger in this country have finally resulted in the collapse of Fernando Delaroe's government following several days of protest.
0,The unemployment rate has passed 18 percent and the hard currency is continuously being devalued.
1,"However, there are a few ambiguous points, such as: \n\t\n\t\n 1 -- What amount of Argentina's economic crisis is due to its relations with the global economy and how much effect will it have on the European and US economies due to its present stagnation?"
1,"2 -- What reaction is likely from other countries and international institutions to the government's new policies, for instance halting the payment of debts?"
1,The important point is that Argentina has enjoyed the IMF's advice in the execution of these policies.
1,The profound economic crisis in Argentina has coincided with a wave of social tension during recent days.
1,"Anyway, now in addition to the IMF, the US government, as the biggest investor in Argentina's economy, is ignoring its commitments in the current situation."
0,"Among them are halting the payment of debts and the execution of supportive actions for the poor people, controlling government and state expenses, attempts to increase employment, giving food help and trying to take out new loans, and the adoption of new monetary policies."
1,"Newspaper reports here Saturday said that it had also sent intelligence agents to interrogate the detainees, something the Foreign Office refused to comment on."
0,The government has sent a team of officials to the camp to assess the conditions of the British prisoners.
1,"The cross-party Parliamentary Human Rights Committee said it was lobbying for a meeting with US ambassador to London William Farish over fears that the 110 detainees held at Camp X-Ray, Guantanamo Bay, are being kept in inhumane conditions."
1,London meanwhile insists it supports US reassurances that the men are being treated humanely.
1,"""It\'s time we became much firmer with the Americans and insisted on the human rights we are all signed up to."""
1,"Ann Clwyd, chairperson for the committee and a member of the ruling Labour party, said it was ""playing with words"" to suggest that the detainees were not prisoners of war."
1,"Clwyd said the purpose of meeting Farish was to ""to voice concern about the treatment of all the people taken prisoner in Afghanistan, not just the ones being held in Cuba, and we want an acceptance that they are prisoners of war."""
0,"The makeshift outdoor facility houses single cells, each with a concrete floor, wooden roof and chain-link walls."
1,"We fought the war shoulder to shoulder, now it seems that we are being frozen out of the aftermath."
1,"She added that there was ""substantial concern"" among Labour members and called for a government statement on the situation."
1,"""It\'s time we had a clear statement on the position of the prisoners and what the British role now is."
1,"The United States says the detainees are illegal combatants, not prisoners of war, and thus do not have rights under the Geneva Convention of 1949, which sets out the laws of war."
1,"LONDON, Jan 19 (AFP) -- British members of parliament Saturday [19 January] called for a meeting with the US ambassador and urged the government to make a clear statement in response to growing concerns about the treatment of al-Qa'ida suspects, including three Britons, held at an US detention centre in Cuba."
1,"Although there are care centres and orphanages in Pietermaritzburg, McKerrow's study found that extended families and the community were willing to take in these children."
1,"Six years ago McKerrow and a colleague at the Edendale Hospital, Annelise Verbeek, pioneered a study entitled Models of Care for Children in Distress, a term they coined for abandoned, displaced and orphaned children in the region."
1,"One in four children in the KwaZulu-Natal capital of Pietermaritzburg has been orphaned by Aids, and the number is set to rocket in the next 10 years."
0,"He said: ""The number of orphans is not a static thing. . ."
0,"Six years later, the number has risen to 25%."
0,The number rises to 100 000 if surrounding areas in the Midlands are included.
1,"Every day an orphan is being created and I know the problem is enormous in the province."""
0,"According to Statistics SA, the city has 193 000 children in that age group out of a total population of 573 000."
0,McKerrow estimates there are 4.6 million orphans countrywide.
1,"Yvonne Spain, the co-ordinator of Children In Distress, a network of more than 50 organisations and people, said communities were absorbing the children, ""but the fact of the matter is that, as multiple deaths occur, that safety net will fall apart""."
0,"A study by Dr Neil McKerrow, chief paediatrician at Pietermaritzburg's Metropolitan Hospitals Complex, shows that 50 000 Aids orphans live in the city."
1,"The director of the provincial Aids Action Unit, Dr Sandile Buthelezi, admitted the city faced ""quite a problem"" and suggested this week the figures might even be higher than McKerrow\'s."
0,They found that 6% of children in Pietermaritzburg were Aids orphans.
0,Buthelezi said the provincial health department was working closely with the welfare community and the private sector to secure funding for bodies working with Aids orphans.
0,McKerrow estimates that the number of orphans in the Midlands will top 250 000 by 2010.
1,"At an informal meeting three weeks ago, the city council was told that, according to estimates from teachers, there were now as many as 100 000 Aids orphans in the city, but city health officials say these numbers appear to be too high."

0,"Over the last few months, Israeli forces have been targeting the symbols of authority of the Palestinian administration."
0,The Palestinian leader has been confined here for several months and the buildings in this complex house the bulk of the security forces of the Palestinian Authority.
1,There is a possibility that the attack on the PA's headquarters could expand into a larger operation.
1,"As events over the past two years indicate, a strategy based on imposing a settlement through military means will only deepen anger and provoke retaliatory violence from the Palestinians."
1,"The just-concluded Arab summit had unanimously adopted a Saudi peace initiative, which called for full Israeli withdrawal from Arab territory occupied in the 1967 war, the creation of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and a ""fair solution"" to the Palestinian refugee problem based on UN resolutions."
1,"Describing !\nArafat as ""an enemy"" of Israel, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced an extended military operation against ""Palestinian terrorism"" ""everywhere it exists""."
1,"In return, the Arabs had agreed to consider that the Arab-Israeli conflict is at an end, enter into peace treaties with Israel and open normal relations in the context of this comprehensive peace."
1,Israel's immediate response to the peace plan was to dismiss it as a non-starter.
1,The attack on the PA headquarters barely a day after the peace initiative was accepted by the Arabs clearly indicates Israel's rejection of any efforts to negotiate peace through compromise.
1,The international community must act immediately to pressure the Israeli government to step back from the dangerous course of action it is determined to pursue.
0,Tanks were moved into Ramallah early Friday morning and subsequently these and bulldozers were used to smash through the perimeter of the compound around Mr Arafat's headquarters.
1,Israel's attack on Arafat's headquarters deals a stinging slap on the face of ongoing Arab efforts to negotiate a political settlement to the ongoing conflict.
1,It has been clear for some time that the Sharon government is planning on settling issues with the Palestinians through invasion and re-occupation of Palestinian land and then offering a settlement based on its terms.
1,Any hopes that were raised by the Arab peace plan have been dashed to pieces with Israel attacking the offices of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Ramallah.
1,Friday's attack strikes at the heart of this authority.
1,The attack on the PA headquarters is an explosive move and has put West Asia on the brink of another war.
1,"As usual, Israel is projecting its attack as a defensive action - a response to two suicide attacks over the last two days at Netanya and a Jewish settlement, which left about 24 people dead."
0,The neighbors lack an extradition treaty.

1,"Lecaros, from the foreign ministry, said the arrest was a sign that the ASEAN, ""particularly Malaysia, is succeeding in the effort against terrorism."""
0,Bernama quoted Malaysian police chief Norian Mai as saying police would try to hand Misuari and his men over to the Philippine government as soon as possible.

0,A source at the Malaysian embassy in Manila said the Royal Malaysian Police intercepted Misuari's speedboat and arrested all its occupants.
0,Tiglao said he had been informed that Misuari was taken to the Sabah state capital of Kota Kinabalu.

1,"""Misuari is not just any lawbreaking person,"" Lecaros said."
1,"MANILA, Nov 24 (AFP) - President Gloria Arroyo praised Malaysia on Saturday for the swift arrest of Muslim leader Nur Misuari, whose forces embarked on a fresh rebellion this week in the southern Philippines."

1,But those agencies are not putting their letterhead on anything.
1,"Marx understands ""the importance of the menu"" for gaining the creditors\' good will."
1,"On the other hand, for now, the creditors do not see any signals of concrete support from the G-7."
1,"As El Cronista was told by a source from an investment bank who followed the visit closely, that issue has various aspects: the economy minister's gradual loss of credibility, the confusion about the role of Jacob Frenkel and Merrill Lynch, and the economic team's apparent lack of a strategy, as well as the Alliance government's obvious domestic difficulties."
0,"Finance Secretary Daniel Marx has again handled some of the negotiations for the restructuring of the debt, after a management by Rodriguez Giavarini."

1,Rodriguez Giavarini's management took place when there was a deluge of doubts about the sustainability of the plan announced by Cavallo.
1,"Faced With the Crisis, Giavarini Accentuates His Influence"
1,"The first one, which was revealed piecemeal during the tour headed by Fernando de la Rua, is that Domingo Cavallo has become irritating."
1,"Another concern about the negotiation has been generated by the leading role given to Jacob Frenkel, Merrill Lynch's international vice president."
1,"Rodriguez Giavarini has not failed to attend to other matters of his ministry, such as meeting with his Chinese colleague, and preparing to visit Germany, where he will meet tomorrow with President Fernando de la Rua, who will travel there from Buenos Aires."
1,"According to the source, ""A key man is the finance secretary: he must specify the government\'s fiscal margin."""
1,"With the impression that the excursion of the government's top brass to New York did not change the picture much, and that the game is continuing in Buenos Aires for now, Argentina's creditors are preparing for the debt negotiation with various concerns in mind."
0,"Resulting from these dialogues were communiques from the G-7 and the Treasury, with contents to be discussed."
1,"The minister's current priority involves binding wounds opened by his colleague in the Economy Ministry, Domingo Cavallo, which have put the regional union in general, and the relations with Brazil in particular, in a risk zone."
0,"The latter will be reached in the event that the international holders of Argentine bonds agree to swap the instruments, which yield high interest, for others with rates not exceeding 7 percent."
1,"That conduct has heightened the suspicion aimed at Argentina, a disadvantageous situation, with De la Rua even risking his own future in an interview with the US president, George W. Bush, in which Cavallo ultimately did not participate, at the president's order."
1,"""Cavallo cannot say \'take it or leave it,\' as in the local swap,"" noted the source, as an example."
1,"There were meetings at Olivos over the weekend of 3-4 November, which resulted in the official decision to appoint Marx as the main negotiator of the fine print in the agreements."
1,The creditors interpret strategy to mean a clear definition of what is and what is not negotiable.
1,"In fact, the Emerging Markets Creditors Association (EMCA), which meets today, Tuesday, in New York, to deal with the Argentine case, wrote a letter to Cavallo saying that ""a consultation process is an important part of the solution,"" and cautioning that ""the way in which Argentina negotiates with its creditors now will have direct effects on its chances of gaining access to the markets in the future."""

1,The lawyers refused to reveal the source of the documents.
1,"It had already been known that Lebanese Phalangist militias, which perpetrated the massacres, cooperated closely with Israel, but according to the lawyers, various documents now indicate that Israel and the Phalange had planned the actions in the camps in advance, that Israel exercised complete control over the militias, and that, in the wake of the massacres, the Israeli army instructed the Phalange to assume responsibility."
0,"The documents include meeting reports, and intelligence service and interrogation reports."
1,The lawyers expect that the Public Prosecution Office will request Israel to confirm the documents' authenticity.
1,"Judging from a few texts that De Standaard was given access to, the documents seem to be related to the Israeli Kahan Commission."
1,The lawyers deemed it wise to do this now because one of Collignon's questions is connected with the juridical consequences of a Lebanese amnesty law.
1,"On behalf of some Palestinian survivors, lawyers Luc Walleyn and Michael Verhaeghe on 18 June filed a complaint with the Brussels Public Prosecution Office against Sharon and other Israeli and Lebanese persons deemed responsible for the massacres in Beirut."
1,"Lawyers for the survivors, who have filed a complaint against Sharon in Belgium, said this."
1,"According to Belgian and international criminal law, they could be held responsible,"" Verhaeghe said."
0,"A few days after filing the complaint, the lawyers received a stack of documents in Hebrew and in English regarding the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the Sabra and Shatila events."
1,"Tomorrow, the Chamber for Indictments will begin the debate on Investigating Judge Collignon's questions on the legitimacy of the case against Sharon."
0,Senior generals and Sharon bore command responsibility [preceding two words published in English] for the militias' actions.
0,"""In practice, the Phalangist militias operated directly under Israeli command."
0,Brussels - New confidential documents indicate that current Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the army's former leadership were directly responsible for massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in 1982.
0,They gave the entire stack to Investigating Magistrate Patrick Collignon.
0,"In the complaint, Hobeika had not yet been called by name."
1,A ruling is expected by the end of this year or early next year.
1,Walleyn are Verhaeghe are convinced of the authenticity of the documents.
0,This special commission investigated the Sabra and Shatila events in 1982-1983.
1,"In the meantime, the lawyers have also initiated a civil suit against Elie Hobeika, the militia leader who is regarded as one of the main perpetrators of the massacres."
1,"It published a report, but not all the documents and interrogation reports were released, because they were deemed damaging to the state's interests."
0,"In the next stage, 2006-2010, the efficiency of existing nuclear power stations will be stepped up by increasing the utilization of current capacity, extending their service life and increasing capacity by using new-generation power units In 2005, the capacity of all Russian nuclear power stations should total 25.24 GW."
0,It will increase by 3 GW in 2002-05 and by 4.81 GW in 2006-10 to 30.05 GW.
0,"When nuclear power stations account for nearly 20 per cent of total energy generated in the country, nearly 52bn cubic metres of gas will be saved in 2005 and 65.5bn cubic metres in 2010."
0,"The construction of nuclear power stations in Iran, China, India, Kazakhstan and Ukraine will provide 42bn dollars in 2002-2005 and 24bn dollars in 2006-2010."
1,"Moscow, 27 November: Russia intends to modernize and extend the service life of 11 power units in its nuclear power stations by 2005."
0,"This is one of the provisions of the federal programme Energy-Efficient Economy that covers the period from 2002 to 2005 and sets guidelines until 2010, the Government Information Department reported on Tuesday [27 November]."
1,"The programme calls for the overhaul of nuclear power stations with a view to extending their safe and efficient operation, extending the service life of power units, resumption of the construction of power units and compiling a list of promising sites for future nuclear power stations."
0,"Its other provisions include the overhaul and construction of new plants for making fuel elements and the overhaul of ""wet"" nuclear waste storage facilities."
1,"The government, without assets to sell and without the possibility of falling back on the devaluation of its currency, is now condemned to keep on asking for foreign capital to maintain its balance of payments in equilibrium."
1,"In the case of Pakistan, it is this country's geostrategic position in the current crisis that serves to justify the avalanche of loans and trade facilities that are being granted to Islamabad."
1,"The first illustration of a change in the position of the United States (the Fund's leading shareholder) toward countries that may squander the American taxpayer's money was the arrival in September of Ann Krueger, an ultraliberal American, as number two at the IMF."
1,"Since the economic targets the government had promised, particularly the one on a zero budget deficit, were not reached, the board felt it was unable to ""recommend"" releasing a new $1.264 billion tranche that had been scheduled for December as part of last year\'s $22 billion program for Argentina."
0,Unconditional Support
0,The latter was adopted in the end.
1,"And yet, the problem was disposed of in two hours."
1,"Moreover, he found the measures taken by the government to control the [movement] of foreign exchange and limit the flight of capital were ""regrettable"", even though these measures were made more flexible later on."
1,"The IMF administrators' bookkeeping-based decision marks a toughening of its policy, which America's republicans, who are especially critical of the Fund's past largesse, have called for over the past years."
0,"It was taken following the presentation of a report by Chile's Thomas Reichmann, the chief of mission who had been sent to Buenos Aires."
0,"This was the case in particular for Russia, Brazil and now Pakistan."
1,"We also stopped counting the unconditional support the institution has given some heads of state, who are neither especially virtuous nor especially democratic, because it was in the political, commercial and economic interest of the United States to do so."
1,"Moreover, the ""Argentine case"" falls at a bad time."
1,"Furthermore, Argentina is not a priority for the Americans now, confides a member of the IMF."
1,The figures spoke for themselves.
1,The fate of 30 million Argentines depends on this.
0,The government adopted a fixed parity between the dollar and the peso in 1991 in order to stop unrestricted inflation.
1,"Regardless of what happens, the current extremely perilous situation is another setback for the IMF."
1,It has been following Argentina's national accounting with a magnifying glass for the past ten years and it has shown it is incapable of guaranteeing the country's financial equilibrium just as most of the countries that submit to its demands.
1,"According to an eyewitness, this cut and dry, accounting-like decision taken by civil servants, who thus have the power of ""life or death"" over a country, was not the subject of any debate."
1,"Yet, over the past ten years, it has done everything it can to be considered one of the IMF's good pupils."
0,"Three meetings - on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays - under the chairmanship of the institution's director general, Germany's Horst Kohler, usually punctuate their weekly schedule."
1,We have stopped counting the number of times financial bailout plans have been set up to help this or that government in difficulty.
1,President Bush now needs parliamentary votes to get more powers on trade negotiation matters and a green light on the economic stimulation plan that has been dragging along for the past two months.
1,"Buenos Aires privatized, on Washington's recommendation, all of its public companies."
1,"Also, the risk that its bankruptcy will cause a chain reaction and lead to a grave crisis among emerging nations is, according to economists, not very likely or at most limited."
1,"It is the victim of an explosive situation at the economic, political and social levels."
0,"In the case of Russia, it was a matter of helping the former soviet giant consolidate its emerging democracy."
0,"That particular morning, it was Argentina's turn."
1,This was the only concession made to a government that has been struggling to restructure its domestic public debt to avoid having the country simply default on its debt.
0,Will Argentina be declared bankrupt on 19 December?
0,"During these meetings, they review various subjects and in particular the achievements of ""under program"" countries."
0,"December 5, was a Wednesday like any other for the 24 executive directors of the International Monetary Fund [IMF]."
1,"In the event of non-payment, the country will find itself an outcast of the international financial community."
1,The president could not take any risk of ruffling the republicans.
1,This position is surprising all the same because the history of the IMF is lined with derogations.
1,"Shortly thereafter, the institution\'s spokesman, Thomas Dawson, declared ""the [Argentine] authorities have to reach the program goals they set for themselves"" before they can get any more money."
0,Brazil has had time to lessen its dependence on trade links with Argentina.
0,The other emerging nations are calling on foreign capital less since the Asian crisis and a sharp ebb in investments would not have the dramatic impact that it had in 1997-1998.
1,"In essence, it seems that they all agreed on one thing: meeting a commitment is inviolable."
1,"For Brazil, the Fund intervened in October 1998, between two rounds in the presidential election, to support Fernando Henrique Cardoso\'s reelection because his macroeconomic options fell in line with the Fund\'s requirements, contrary to his leftist adversary, Luis Inacio ""Lula"" da Silva."
1,"Hence, a foreign debt of $130 billion and the urgent need for an inflow of capital from the IMF to repay $2 billion in debt that is coming due on 19 December."
1,Argentina has none of these worthy arguments.
1,"At most, a few differences in sensitivity emerged over whether or not the issue should remain closed from one to two months or if the discussions with Argentina should continue."
1,One can easily talk in a similar manner of the racial discrimination in the United States which is becoming more serious with the passage of time.
1,"The United States, however, is not qualified to speak of ""human rights"" in other countries."
1,"When voices critical of the Israelis' violation of the Palestinian people's human rights were raised at the conference, the United States went so far as to withdraw its delegation."
1,They responded that three out of ten blacks could not find job or have been denied responsible positions in the workplace simply because they were blacks and eight out of ten blacks and two thirds of the Latinos and Asians said they had suffered persecution and had been subjected to abusive language.
0,"As a result of racial discrimination, many among the ethnic minorities reportedly have been driven out of urban areas."
1,"Recalling the scene, Ali Barr said: ""Myself and my company were racially discriminated against."
1,Many people in the United States have their human rights ruthlessly trampled upon simply because they are colored.
0,"A total of 1,709 people, including blacks, Latinos, and Asians, participated in the poll."
0,"Ali Barr [name as published], a black man working at a TV station in Atlanta, has recently experienced racial discrimination in a restaurant."
1,"In the beginning, the United States refused to send a delegation, but eventually dispatched a low-level delegation."
1,"Instead of talking about ""human rights issues"" of other countries, the United States should find out how things are in its own house where the abuse of human rights is rampant and make effort to rectify the practices."
0,"According to 2000 vital statistics released not so long ago in the United States, one out of four residents of the suburban areas was an ethnic minority."
1,"The great leader [yongdoja] Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: \n\t\n\t\n ""Although the imperialists and reactionaries speak ill of socialism and pretend to be the \'advocates of human rights,\' they are the ones who really abuse human rights."""
1,"According to a poll conducted jointly by the US daily ""The Washington Post"" and Harvard University, people are wondering whether the American society is not reverting to the 1960s when racial discrimination was very serious."
1,"When Ali Barr and his company entered the restaurant, ten white people inside the restaurant appeared surprised to see them and a waitress told them to leave the premise immediately."
1,"More often than not, the United States, acting as if it were an ""adjudicator of human rights,"" published the so-called ""Annual Human Rights Report"" and ""Annual Report on International Religious Freedom,"" attempting to teach a lesson or two to countries -- including our country -- it deems disagreeable."
1,"People will likely remember the fact that the United States withdrew its delegation from the UN conference against racism held last September in Durban, South Africa."
1,"At a recent United Nations meeting, the United States picked a quarrel with us by speaking as if our country had a ""human rights problem."""
1,"Since this is how a government claiming to represent its people behaves in international settings, it is no wonder people at home follow the government's example."
1,This was not the first time the United States acted this way.
0,This figure is said to be 5 percent higher than it was a decade ago.
1,"I can never forget what I saw that day as long as I live."""
1,"However, we will not look back at the entire century that has just passed."
1,"The other has no other homeland than France, which does not, however, lead him to deny his heritage from ancient Israel (which contains, like all heritages, the best and the worst) nor to be indifferent to the destiny of those millions of Jews who have something in common with him."
1,What would remain of the ideals of those who saw themselves as their liberators of their people and as builders?
1,"Let us content ourselves with reiterating the evidence: Since June 1967, the West Bank and Gaza have been occupied and dominated territories, crushed politically, socially, economically."
1,"Whom does he think he resembles, if not the perpetrator of the Sabra and Shatila massacres?"
0,"The United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand were all created at the conclusion of a colonial process."
1,Can we seriously imagine the crimes that would have to be committed to achieve this result?
1,"Today, he is being completely isolated and the desire to drive him away is scarcely disguised."
1,"On the Israeli side, despite the process, settlement has increased considerably, eating away at the supposedly autonomous Palestinian territories crisscrossed by ""bypass roads."""
1,"This applies to all the problems under discussion, including, of course, the issue of Jerusalem and of the refugees."
1,The second is that of reciprocity.
1,"Asking this question at least serves as a reminder that, although many have already left, thereby reinventing the Diaspora, the Israelis want to stay and do not intend to end up like French Algeria."
1,"Likewise, the more recent creation of Israel was accompanied, under the indifferent gaze of the Western and Soviet world, by the forced exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians."
1,"Like any form of state terrorism, it is above all contradictory."
1,"On the Palestinian side, feeding on the growing frustration of the occupied population, a wing has broken off, conducting a policy of terror and death that horrifies us."
1,"These days, when everything seems to be collapsing in the Middle East, both the Palestinians' chances of finally having a state in which their people would be sovereign, and the Israelis' chances of integrating themselves into a region where -- need we be reminded? -- the Arabs are in the overwhelming majority, we believe it our duty to voice a few basic truths."
1,"It must be acknowledged that the government of Ariel Sharon has so far taken the opposite tack and that, while he has grudgingly recognized the Palestinians' right to a state, it has been under conditions such that this state, reduced to a series of Bantustans, has no chance of living and developing peacefully."
1,"We still want to hope that the ""rest of Israel,"" as the prophets called it, is the ""mustard seed"" another prophet referred to."
1,"Those involved in it had no shortage of arguments, whether Arab, Jewish, or simply clear-headed."
1,It is absolutely impossible for the time being.
1,We are both historians.
1,Ariel Sharon's immediate exploitation of the 11 September massacres is an unmistakable sign.
1,"Today, these refugees and their descendants do not call into question the existence of the state of Israel as long as the injustice suffered is recognized and the implementation of their rights is negotiated fairly."
1,"The other solution is the opposite of the first one: the departure of the Israelis to more hospitable climes, in the United States or Europe."
1,There was a quarrel concerning Zionism.
1,"It also applies for Palestinian citizens of Israel who, 53 years after the creation of the state, are still far from equal."
1,"From the current perspective, three solutions seem ""logical."""
1,"It now resembles the destruction of the very people, so structured and organized is it."
1,Any renunciation of sovereignty by either party must be compensated by the other.
1,It furthermore holds for the Israelis who decide to remain in Palestinian territory and who must no longer be encysted there.
1,This process has not achieved its goal.
1,"Today, two forms of terrorism fuel each other."
1,How to escape from this situation?
1,"We do hope so, against all hope."
1,"The third solution consists of coexistence, whether it takes the form of two separate states or a federation or a confederation."
1,"Palestinian terrorism, which existed on a very small scale in the time of Yitzhak Rabin, has taken on a dramatic dimension."
1,"The Israeli ambassador in France, Elie Barnavi, recently made two contradictory statements: That all those who, like Nurit Peled, believe that the Sharon government is a ""government of death"" could easily fit into a telephone booth... and that by their existence they constitute Israel\'s very honor."
1,"Despite this, the Palestinian resistance has formally recognized the existence of Israel and begun a peace process in Oslo, while the state of Israel has recognized the Palestinians represented by the PLO and its leader Yasser Arafat."
1,Sharon compared Arafat to Bin Ladin and Mullah Omar put together.
1,"But the Israeli response, with its ""extra-judicial liquidations,"" is even more dramatic in a certain sense."
1,"The first is that of not only civic, but also social and economic, equality."
1,This principle applies primarily to the attitudes that must prevail during any future negotiations.
1,"Two basic principles could still, perhaps, make it possible."
1,"Zionism established itself in a sensitive region of the world at a time when nothing seemed more ""normal"" than to settle in someone else\'s territory."
1,A recently assassinated minister favored this solution.
1,Can anyone believe that the Arab world could approve of it?
1,"Yesterday, Yasser Arafat was being asked to police the area he was supposed to be in charge of, while destroying the instruments of his power."
1,"The first is the expulsion of the Palestinians from what is known as Eretz Israel, from all of Mandatory Palestine."
1,No one today challenges their existence despite the crises arising from this process and which were cited by an Aboriginal athlete at the Olympic Games in Sydney.
1,"What would then remain of the universal character of the prophets of Israel -- that of the second Isaiah, for example -- and of Israeli citizens' hope of one day living in peace in this region?"
1,Extremists on both sides have clearly understood this and have derived nothing but encouragement from it.
0,One of us is a Palestinian patriot (and not a nationalist).
1,This is taking place at a time when the government of [George W.] Bush has been identified as the top violator of human rights of the last Christian year because of the restrictions imposed on the American citizens under the excuse of fighting terrorism.
1,"They cannot, therefore, blame the world for viewing such reports as a tool to advance America's foreign policy."
1,"The most interesting point is that America has been expelled from membership of the international human rights organization, because of its repeated violation of human rights."
1,"Only after the extensive protest of the world [media] and the human rights organizations, the American administration was compelled to partially recognize this right."
1,The State Department's current expression of view on human rights records of other countries is in fact the continuation of the same unilateral policy pursued by the American administration.
1,"The American administration, during Bush's presidency in particular, has adopted unilateral policies over such international issues as the reduction of strategic arms, environmental concerns including the Kyoto protocol, proposal to set up an international criminal court and lately over the fight against terrorism."
1,"The American Department of State, in its annual report on human rights, has accused a number of countries, including Iran, of human rights violations."
1,The American administration is keeping the Taleban and Al-Qa'idah prisoners in metal cages named detention centres and it is refusing to identify them as prisoners of war.
1,"How can, under such circumstances, America allow itself to express an opinion over the issue of human rights in other countries?"
1,"That is, American administration assumes the right to interfere in all international issues and internal affairs of other countries, but itself does not care about the concern of the global community vis-a-vis the American policies which at times influence a large part of the world."
1,"Moreover, the American administration has violated the rights of the minorities and in particular the Muslim minority who have migrated to America."
1,It seems that America's unilateral policy does not identify any limits for itself.
1,"So far the Bush administration has denied its citizens their legitimate rights, has set up military courts to try the people charged with terrorism without giving the accused the right of appeal or the basic right to appoint a lawyer."
1,This is another example of human rights violations in America.
1,"It is a human virtue to express concern on human rights issues in the world, but the American authorities - after massacring thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan under the excuse of fighting terrorism which is still continuing - cannot expect the people of the world to take seriously the annual report issued by their Department of State on human rights."
1,"China had always ""firmly opposed"" the US Taiwan Affairs Act, which mandates by law the US defense of Taiwan and forms the basis for US arms sales to the island, he said."
1,In a press conference on the sidelines of the current full session of parliament -- his annual opportunity to present China's foreign policy objectives to the outside world -- Tang largely steered clear of subjects over which Beijing and Washington disagree.
1,"""President Jiang and President Bush held an important meeting in Shanghai in October where they agreed that both countries would work together to build a constructive and cooperative relationship."
1,"When asked whether the anti-terror alliance meant good relations between the country were based purely on expediency, Tang disagreed, saying cooperation ""was long-term""."
1,"""I wish to emphasize that the Taiwan question remains the most sensitive and most important issue at the core of the Sino-US relationship,"" he said."
1,"BEIJING, March 6 (AFP) -- China\'s foreign minister on Wednesday pledged to expand ""constructive and cooperative"" relations with the United States, in a notably conciliatory performance at his annual get-together with the media."
1,"""This is a very important consensus,"" Tang said."
1,Sino-US relations took a more serious dip a month afterwards during a crisis over the collision between a US surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet over the South China Sea.
1,"Even when the perennially divisive issue of Taiwan was raised by reporters, he offered only mild and routine criticism of US policy towards the island."
1,Sino-US ties have greatly improved since Beijing backed the US fight against global terrorism and its bombing campaign of terrorist targets in Afghanistan following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.
1,However he stressed that Taiwan remained the crucial issue between the two.
1,"Overall, despite a ""grim and complicated"" post September 11 international order, China still maintained that ""peace, stability and development"" remained the main themes characterizing the world environment, Tang said."
1,"""We are ready to work together with the US side to narrow differences, expand common ground, increase exchanges and promote cooperation in order to further push forward the constructive and cooperative ties,"" Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told journalists."
1,"Tang conceded there had been ""twists and turns"" following US President George W. Bush\'s accession to the US presidency in early last year, but said the relationship had improved with Bush\'s visits to China in October and last month."
1,"The tone of Tang's press conference was markedly different to that of last year's equivalent event, during which he roundly criticised United States arms sales to Taiwan."
0,"Tang further announced that Liu Jieyi, the director general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry section in charge of arms control, was in Washington for talks on weapons proliferation and issues concerning the global security."
1,US accusations of China's alleged proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have long been countered by Beijing with loud opposition to US weapon sales to Taiwan.
1,"Tang called on Washington to uphold the so-called ""one China policy"" -- the centrepiece of Beijing\'s dealings with Taiwan which categorises the island is an inalienable part of mainland territory -- but failed to specifically condemn Washington\'s arms sales to Taipei."
1,China will seek to improve the relationship still further during visits by President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Hu Jintao to Washington later this year.
1,"On the other hand, the report described South Korea as ""generally respecting the human rights of its citizens"" although problems remain in some areas."
1,"The report also noted improvement in human rights records in such countries as Bahrain, Peru, Qatar and Oman."
0,"Other problems cited in the report include domestic violence, rape, child abuse, legal and societal discrimination against women and ethnic minorities."
1,"In connection with freedom of speech and press, the report said the Seoul government abandoned direct control over the news media, but it continues to exercise indirect influence, and government officials vigorously lobby reporters and editors."
1,"""Citizens are detained arbitrarily, and many are held as political prisoners and prison conditions are harsh."
1,"The constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary and fair trials are not implemented in practice,"" the report said."
1,"The U.S. State Department published its annual human rights country report Monday, reconfirming poor human rights conditions in North Korea."
1,It cited controversial massive tax probes of media firms which critics accused of being an attempt to curb media criticism of the government while the government maintained the tax audit was a legitimate activity and long overdue.
1,"The report pointed out as ""remaining problems"" in South Korea, police\'s physical or verbal abuses of detainees at times and the National Security Law (NSL)\'s infringement upon free expression and other civil liberties."
0,"The report, however, noted the government has taken various steps to improve its human rights record."
1,"The ""Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001,"" submitted to Congress, said North Korea\'s human rights record remained poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses."
1,"Meanwhile, the report called Afghanistan ""a triumph for human rights in 2001,"" saying that after the U.S.-led war on terrorism, Afghan citizens have been released from the brutal and oppressive rule of the Taliban and Afghan women, who suffered violence and repression, are now beginning to resume their roles in society."
1,It also estimated that anywhere from several hundreds of thousands to two million people died from starvation and related diseases.
0,"South Korea was cited in the report as a ""major transit point for alien smugglers, including traffickers of primarily Asian women and children for the sex trade and domestic servitude."""
1,"In particular, trafficking in persons was a problem."
0,Other human rights abuses in the North included extrajudicial executions and disappearances.
1,It also noted President Kim Dae-jung stated repeatedly that promoting the rights of women was a priority goal.
1,"However, the report comprehensively blamed the North Korean authorities for committing wrong-doings in terms of human rights."
1,The U.S. report stated North Korean residents have no power to peacefully replace their government and cited reports of executions of citizens in the North.
1,"""The U.S. report is feared to further encourage North Korea\'s resistance against the United States, which was triggered by Bush\'s recent Seoul visit,"" a government source said Tuesday."
1,"Recently, North Korea strongly denounced comments made by U.S. President George W. Bush during his Seoul visit last month accusing the North Korean leadership of starving its people while developing weapons of mass destruction."
1,"Meanwhile, some experts do not regard future Pyongyang-Washington relations with such pessimism, saying this year's U.S. human rights report on North Korea was not as severe as previous years."
1,"The U.S. State Department on Tuesday (KST) rated the human rights situation in North Korea ""poor"" in its annual human rights report, casting dark clouds on the already tense relationship between Pyongyang and Washington."
1,"The report particularly designated North Korea, along with Myanmar, China, Iran, Iraq and Sudan as countries of special concern in connection with religious oppression."
1,Such an unfavorable report for North Korea is likely to produce a negative effect on Pyongyang-Washington relations for the time being.
1,"North Korea is expected to call the U.S. administration\'s report a ""groundless plot"" or an ""intervention of domestic affairs."""
1,It also took issue with the lack of religious freedom in the communist country.
1,"In the department\'s human rights report, the United States did not use the term ""axis of evil,"" which first appeared during President Bush\'s State of the Union address in late January."
1,"""Authorities still were quick to suppress any person or group, whether religious, political, or social, that they perceived to be a threat to government power or to national stability, and citizens who sought to express openly dissenting political and religious views continued to live in an environment filled with repression,"" the report charged."
1,"""This is unreasonable and done with ulterior motives,"" he said."
1,The United States has rejected China's repeated calls to consider Xinjiang separatists as terrorists.
1,"The 2001 Country Reports on Human Rights, released in Washington Monday, also gave poor grades on rights to North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Myanmar [Burma] and Vietnam as well as mixed reviews to Indonesia and Cambodia."
1,"BEIJING, March 5 (AFP) -- Beijing condemned Tuesday as ""unreasonable"" an annual US State Department report that criticised China\'s human rights record for abuses including torture and the repression of religious and ethnic minorities."
1,"""The US government turns a blind eye to this situation and points fingers at the internal affairs of other countries and distorts the status of human rights in other countries."
1,Kong also warned Washington against double standards in the global war against terrorism.
1,"""The Chinese government and people express their deep dissatisfaction and firm opposition,"" he told a press conference."
1,"Beijing\'s human rights record throughout 2001 ""remained poor"", the State Department concluded in its scathing 70,000-word report."
1,"""East Turkestan forces are participating in and fighting with the Taliban, this is a fact known to all, they are a component of international terrorist forces and a target of international forces fighting terrorism,"" he said."
1,"Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent ""East Turkestan"" in China\'s western-most Xinjiang region were terrorists who had cooperated with Afghanistan\'s former Taliban regime and needed to be wiped out, he said."
1,"The Chinese government was devoted to promoting and safeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms, Kong said, and added there were ""numerous cases"" of human rights violations in the United States."
1,"""The State Department 2001 human rights report goes against the facts and is interference in China\'s internal affairs under the pretext of human rights,"" foreign ministry spokesman Kong Quan said."
0,"GCEP, an agency operating under the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, is the country's point of reference for environmental pacts."
0,"In 1997, at a UN conference in Kyoto, Japan, the Kyoto Protocol legally obliged developed countries to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by 8 per cent (below 1990 levels) between 2008 and 2012."
1,"With the signing of the protocol, he said, GCEP hopes to attract more funding to contribute to the international community's efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the earth's atmosphere thus causing climate change."
0,"""Soon, the government will delegate Jordan\'s representative to the United Nations, HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad, to sign the protocol,"" Juneidi told The Jordan Times on Tuesday, adding that an exact date for signing of the environmental agreement had not been set."
1,"Other developed countries like Canada have shown reluctance towards signing the Kyoto Protocol, saying it would cut the national GDP by up to 2.5 per cent in 2010 and cause economic damage worth 30 billion Canadian dollars ($19 billion)."
1,"In March 2001, the US administration opposed the protocol by saying that it contravenes US economic interests, a decision slammed by European Union countries at the time."
1,"Although developed countries are the world\'s main source of large-scale air pollution, Jordan\'s decision to sign the protocol is aimed at stressing its ""commitment towards the different international conventions,"" Juneidi said."
0,Instead the US government produced its own alternative climate change strategy aimed at encouraging industries to trim their emissions.
0,"AMMAN -- Jordan said it will sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact on impeding global greenhouse gas emissions, following a recent Cabinet decision, according to Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP)."
1,"On Monday, the 15 European Union member states agreed to be formally bound to the Kyoto accord, and complete the ratification by June 1 this year."
0,"At this ceremony, Seyed Mohammad Jalali Parvin, the managing director and a member of the board of directors of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Law Enforcement Forces' Cooperatives Foundation, presented some awards to the superior companies which had taken part at the exhibition."
1,"Touching on the importance of modern technology in preventing and reducing crimes in society, Parvin also thanked the active participation of local and foreign companies at Iran's First International Police and Security Equipment exhibition."

1,"""This clearly undermines the independence of the Commission and will erode public\'s confidence on it."""
1,The NGOs stressed the government has also failed to respect or recognise Suhakam's recommendations and also lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia.
1,"""The NGOs note with deep concern that the government has largely ignored Suhakam\'s maiden report and its freedom of assembly report."
1,"""When the bill (Suhakam Act ) was tabled in the parliament, our Foreign Affairs Minister (Syed Hamid Albar) promised that this would be a positive development in protecting and promoting human rights in Malaysia."
1,Ramdas said Suhakam's performance will be judged not on the number of statements issued or reports produced but on the improvement of human rights in Malaysia.

0,"5:14pm Sat May 4th, 2002 -- Thirty-two non-governmental organisations [NGOs] today said they have suspended all engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission or Suhakam for 100 days since April 24 - when the latest appointments to the commission took effect."
0,"""We will also note to what extent Suhakam will monitor the government\'s compliance with previous recommendations on various human rights issues contained in its maiden report to the Parliament as well as its other reports,"" he added."
1,He added the boycott could create the impression that the NGOs were acting out of self interest and are not honest about championing human rights.
1,"Ramdas said the government\'s failure to adhere to the commission\'s recommendations creates the impression that Suhakam is nothing but ""a mere public relations tool""."
0,"Elaborating further on the boycott, Ramdas said the NGOs will not hold any dialogues, send any memorandums or complaints to Suhakam."
1,"""Our concern is whether persons used to the role of policy implementors can objectively assess and critique executive policies which impinge on human rights,"" said Ramdas."
1,"Ramdas said it was perceived that Anuar and Mehrun, instrumental behind the scathing Kesas report, were dropped for performing their duties without fear or favour."
1,The NGOs also expressed concern over the appointment of five new commissioners which has led to Suhakam being made up mostly of retired civil servants.
1,"""The fact that three commissioners have now been axed is a clear signal to other commissioners that their tenure is dependent on whether or not they have pleased the executive."
1,"The NGOs also noted that the government has yet to show its commitment and respect for universal human rights principles by ratifying the international instruments of human rights, namely the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Covenant Against Torture."
0,"Apart from Hakam, other notable NGOs involved in the boycott are the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC), Suaram, Amesty International's Malaysian chapter, Jamaah Islah Malaysia (Jim) and Sisters in Islam (SIS)."
1,"On the other hand, the NGOs said there is nothing in the public records which shows that Abu Talib was committed to protecting civil liberties and advancing human rights."
1,"Meanwhile, another concern raised was Suhakam's independence following the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as its new chairperson and the decision not to renew the appointments of three commissioners, Anuar Zainal Abidin, Prof Mehrun Siraj and Dr Salleh Mohd Nor."
1,"The Kesas report irked Mahathir after it found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering along the Kesas highway on Nov 5, 2000."

0,According to Ramdas the NGOs will meet again after the 100-day period to review their position.

1,"However, she refrains from mentioning the elected Israeli leadership, which moved the Israeli army to occupy Palestinian cities, destroy homes over the heads of their owners, arrest thousands of innocent people, and carry out what many legal and international humanitarian circles described as war crimes or bloody massacres to say the least."
1,"No one, no matter who it is, has the right to meddle in the Palestinian domestic affairs or to impose on the Palestinian people a leadership favored by the US Administration and the Israeli Government and tailored according to their mutual interests."
1,The US legislative branch even outbade the Israeli right wing.
1,"The calls in Washington for democracy, transparency, and corruption-free system are only made to serve US plans, not out of concern about nations' interests."
1,"Rice is aware of the fact that President Yasir Arafat remained under siege in his headquarters in Ramallah for five months, imposed on him by the superior Israeli military in violation of all the accords that were signed by former Israeli governments and guaranteed by the United States."
1,"The second fact is that if Washington is interested in democratic reforms in order to combat terrorism as it says it is, it should pressure the Israeli leadership to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories and stop its repressive practices against the Palestinian people."
1,The Congress' resolutions and the statements made by leaders and members of the Congress revealed the US Administration's harbored intentions.
1,"However, there are two facts that ought to be highlighted."
1,The US national security adviser should have called for ending the occupation and dismantling the settlements.
1,"Rice attacks the Palestinian leadership, which was democratically elected, as testified by international observers, including former US presidents."
1,The legislative branch took part in this oneupmanship by issuing resolutions showing full allegiance to the radical right wing in Israel.
1,"Yet, the Palestinian leadership is denounced and attacked while the Israeli prime minister is praised."
1,"The first is that the current Palestinian leadership represents the Palestinian people's will, political convictions, and national aspirations."
1,"She knows for certain that this occupation and the settlements, which the Israeli government refuses to remove, represent the only major obstacle to peace."
1,"Even the most radical Israeli hardliners expressed the idea of the transfer more politely than the most senior, elected US bodies, which called on the Palestinians to give up the West Bank and look for what they called another homeland."
1,"The US president described him as a man of peace, thereby prompting the world's ridicule sometimes and denunciation at other times."
1,"So, why do Rice and the US Administration launch campaigns against, and interfere in the affairs of, the Palestinian leadership?"
1,"The Palestinians did not attack Israeli cities, did not arrest thousands of Israeli citizens, and did not blockade their cities and villages, as was done to the Palestinian people without exception."
1,It was only natural for US National Security Adviser condoleezza Rice to make statements yesterday after what can be described as a oneupmanship of rudeness was inaugurated in Washington last week.
1,"They served as a crude example of the arrogance of power and attempts to control nations' resources, dictate policies, and impose leaders through pressure and coercion."
1,"The flagrant attack, which Condoleezza Rice launched on the Palestinian leadership yesterday, demonstrates how international dictatorship is practiced by the most powerful country on earth, which claims to be democratic and an advocate of nations' right to choose their leaders."
1,"The United States turns a blind eye to these practices, pretending to forget that they violate human rights and are continuously denounced by the international community."
1,"These accords explicitly stipulated that Israeli forces must not enter the Palestinian-controlled areas, which are called Areas A and cover all the Palestinian cities, naturally including Ramallah."
1,"A prominent Israeli official, Shim\'on Peres, said when his army moved into the Janin refugee camp: ""I am afraid that a massacre may have been committed in the Janin camp."""
1,"Moreover, the aim of these plans is to make the Palestinians yield to the dictates of the Israeli-US alliance, which seeks a mimic resolution to the Palestinian issue, which will perpetuate the occupation and facilitate the expansion of settlements."
1,"For its part, the Palestinian leadership has always sought a just peace, not submission to plans aimed at writing off the Palestinian issue and swallowing the West Bank and Gaza Strip."
1,Both Washington and Israel must realize that the Palestinian people are intelligent enough to read between the lines and understand the long-term aims behind Condoleezza Rice's statements.
1,Rice's statements came to dot the i's and cross the t's.

1,"We want the Protocol to enter into force before the World Summit on Sustainable Development this summer."""
1,"The Commissioner finally welcomed indications by Japan, New Zealand and Norway that they are preparing for ratification, and strongly called on others, notably Russia, to do the same."
1,The scientific evidence on climate change is stronger than ever.
1,I am confident that Member States will take the necessary steps in order to allow for a simultaneous ratification together with the European Community before 1 June 2002.
1,"The Commissioner concluded by stressing the need for further EU emission reduction measures: ""The European Commission has already proposed measures to reduce emissions at the lowest economic cost, including an EC-wide emissions trading scheme to begin in 2005."
1,"Referring to President Bush\'s climate change plan for the US that he announced on 14 February the Commissioner noted: ""These proposals will not lead to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but allow a significant increase."

1,Today the Council of EU environment ministers adopted the Commission's proposal for a decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.

1,"The President of the European Commission Romano Prodi said: ""Today is an historical moment for European efforts to combat climate change."
1,I urge our partners both in the developed and in the developing countries to also ratify the Kyoto Protocol soon.
1,"With its decision to ratify the protocol at EU level, the European Union stays true to its ambition to enable the Kyoto Protocol to come into force by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in August/September 2002."
1,"Once again, the EU is exercising leadership in addressing this global environmental problem, as we have done in Bonn and Marrakech last year."

1,The European Commission strongly welcomes this decision.
1,To protect our climate we will have to reduce emissions.
1,The EU continues to call for the United States to participate in the global framework for addressing climate change.
1,I am very pleased that the Council has now approved the Kyoto Protocol thus enabling the EU to proceed with its ratification.
1,"By taking this decision, the EU has reaffirmed its commitment to pursuing multilateral solutions to issues of global concern."

1,"He made such charges despite the fact that women's political, social and cultural participation is not less than that of men."
1,"Copithorne, who has served in the UN post since 1995, through his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), whose 53 member states open an annual six-week session on March 18, has clearly shown that he is under the strong influence of Zionist circles and Washington's biased attitude towards the Islamic Republic."
1,This spiteful attitude clearly shows that Copithorne is only a hireling tasked with tarnishing the image of the Islamic Republic and its senior officials.
1,"In other cases, he made unfounded charges by accusing Iran of discrimination against women and minorities."
1,"Women in Iran hold managerial, academic and parliamentary posts and even have positions in the government and the cabinet."
1,"And as far as minorities are concerned, they enjoy rights equal to those of the Muslim majority, as they have their own representatives in Parliament and practice their religion quite freely."
1,He also tried to portray a false image of the Judiciary and its officials and went so far as to accuse the Judiciary officials of human rights violations!
1,"The UN rapporteur's new report on Iran, which he submitted to the commission on Friday, includes nothing new."
1,This means that his annual anti-Iran reports are only dictated to him by Zionist circles and arrogant powers like the United States that lost their illegitimate interests in Iran with the victory of the Islamic Revolution and downfall of their puppet Pahlavi regime.
1,"In his report, the UN human rights rapporteur also interfered in Iran's internal affairs."
1,"[""Opinion"": ""Independence of UNCHR impugned by biased reports""]"
1,"For instance, he denounced as a human rights violation the banning and seizure of satellite dishes in Iran, while the measure has been taken in line with the law."
1,"Interestingly, although Copithorne has not visited Iran since 1996, he continues to submit his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights without having any knowledge of the realities in the Islamic Republic."
1,Publishing such biased reports will only create mistrust among nations regarding the objectives and independence of the UN Commission on Human Rights.

1,"we want a warm peace, not a cold peace, between our nations."""
1,"What the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia had in mind, he told the New York Times on Sunday, was to offer Israel, in an address at next month\'s Arab League summit in Beirut, ""full withdrawal from all the occupied territories, in accord with UN resolutions, including Jerusalem, for full normalisation of relations"" with the Arab world."
1,"Equally significant was the news that the Israeli Council for Peace and Security, a group of 1,000 top-level reserve generals, colonels and Shin Bet (security intelligence) and Mossad (military intelligence) officials are reportedly planning a public campaign for a ""unilateral"" Israeli withdrawal from all Gaza and much of the West Bank."
1,It demands immediate action.
1,But what makes this offer exceptionally generous is the readiness of a key Arab leader to take this stand at the highest Arab political forum and campaign for it.
1,"But he told the paper\'s columnist Thomas L. Friedman, who has been very critical of Arab governments for sitting on the fence during the 17-month Palestinian uprising, that he has now changed his mind about his prepared speech ""when Sharon took the violence, and the oppression, to an unprecedented level""."

1,"And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up, wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table."
1,"I just got to a certain age and I said, ""No I can\'t do this anymore,"" so I never went back."

1,"Now that knife, when I went to sleep it really scared me."
1,"Um, my dream, my prayers were answered."
0,So they told me about some classes that I could take at Central Piedmont.
1,"Um, that, I really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because I was there I think the first year I went there was the year they built a really nice gym, and I don't think they used that gym no more than three years."
0,I had another sister who went to Gaston College where she got a business degree there.
0,"He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and going to school too."

1,I sat there and I cried but I tried to be as understanding as possible because I knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for us.
1,"As the years went by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said, ""Have you considered being a teacher assistant?"

1,"If I'm not mistaken I think I've been at Berryhill for I think 17 years, 17, 18 years I've been here at Berryhill so and I hope I never have to leave until I retire."
1,But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money.
1,"And I went to, um, one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it, and she thought it was an excellent paper."
1,So I worked maybe like four months in the classroom and that highly put a damper on my wanting\n         to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband.

1,Well I didn't like writing at the time\n         but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper.
1,"And her little girl just complained, ""I don\'t want to wash the dishes."
1,"Out of all of my sisters and brothers I was the laziest one of all, as far as working around the house."
1,"So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family."

1,"But then, after awhile, I fell in love with Berryhill."
1,"The little girl disappointed her mother so badly, but her mother said, ""How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes?"
1,All my life I always wanted to be a teacher even from the time I started to school.
1,"But I love what I do and, uh, anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it so."
1,My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school.

1,well i haven't really really gotten that far with it um i've always sort of liked General Motors a little bit better than some of the others but uh
1,oh yeah i i guess there's a lot to to think about when you're trying to make that decision
1,but you know i'm not so totally hung up on that that i wouldn't buy something else how about you
1,all righty thanks bye-bye
0,oh i guess i really don't know
0,well what do you call them you said amenities
1,especially not after two years
1,i think they have a really good um quality
1,i have preferences for uh for some um makers over others
1,bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years and he lived way out in the country so he put a lot of miles on it
1,brake pads are disposable you know we know that but i never thought a clutch was disposable
1,they seem to be really durable
1,what i would consider to be a long-term investment
0,that they have but what about um their reputation of the company or the price
0,so i don't know i'm i'm not ready to buy a new car yet but i don't know if if the next time i'm going to try to
1,well that's that's a big one in my book but uh um
0,something that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things
0,some of the foreign ones
1,well and i guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know you
1,okay Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy
1,yeah so that was that was kind of a shock
1,several things about the car it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be
1,i would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not any not you know a luxury type
1,yeah i've uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh Mercedes and
1,because several things minor things sort of but still they cost us money um that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay on a car that that was that new
0,we talked long enough
1,okay well enjoyed it bye-bye
1,i guess the commercials are getting to me the Toyota commercials and i know that a lot of people i've i've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any problems at all
0,yeah that i think that's
0,things are you going to consider you know what uh you said something about the about the
0,what kind of what brand of car are you thinking about buying or like what things are you looking at
1,no but on the other hand i guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune
1,how come  i've been kind of um
1,and yet you know it it held up pretty doggone good so
0,even though they do a lot of the work themselves then just buying the parts and everything is is pretty expensive but for them it's it's sort of a hobby too to own them
1,um well of course i guess uh price is always the big consideration
1,um and i would sort of like to buy American
1,it is for me other people don't seem to have the same problem
1,and they just said well you know clutches are disposable and i said since when
0,i really don't know the answer um
1,and you knew it had had been through a whole lot
0,to stay with buying something American or if i'm going to go for a little more
1,yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like like uh
1,yeah well yeah i like i like some of those things they come in really handy
1,oh it's easy to get gas mileage in this car it gets excellent gas mileage
1,yeah that's one of the big throwing cards for
1,well as a matter of fact i was thinking about that the other day and uh
1,well um the last car we bought was American because of because of that reason but have not been entirely happy with um
1,really oh i don't know
1,yeah i wouldn't have thought so either
1,you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes
0,you know we bought the car new and after  um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch
1,oh you do want a lot of that stuff
1,um a Mercedes Benz they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable
0,um-hum my uh daughter has owned two different ones and uh

1,one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns but i don't think we should be carrying Uzis either  you know what i mean  yeah i know i mean i don't think machine guns automatic weapons i don't believe in things like that but i think
1,that everyone should have the right to have a hand gun in their house if they so choose and but i think there should be some  restrictions when you buy one you know they should do more background search on you they should i think it should be harder to buy one

0,"What we learned from muslim scholars is that robbing the religion\nfrom muslims, is greater than robbing their honor and land, god said ""turmoil is greater\nthan murder"", and for those devils, their danger is greater than who rapes, or rob and steal\nmoney or land."
0,"Mamun al-`Alwani, al-Anbar governor, attached to you the security report in\n   Ramadi."

0,"In the morning infidels announced in their\n      satellite channels that Nasr al-Fahdawi welcomed Ibrahim al-Ja'fari in Ramadi,\n      then by noon, they announced his assasination, thank god."
0,"Second question: Why did we announce and started fighting the Shiites and police from\nthe start, even thought most of the Jihadist sectors and the public didn't understand what\nwe want, and didn't know the importance of starting with those, so what's the objection\non killing and executing the Sheiks now and without a notice, with continiuing making\npeople understand it, just like we did by killing the police then, were people satisfied with\nus?"
0,"Our state council forbids from targeting Sunni police, or killing and eliminating the\ninfidels and traitors without going back to the council, and you know that assasinations\nare about good apportunities, and monitoring a person could take days or weeks."
0,We need premission for these names:
0,"For the other tribes, their reaction was as follows:"
0,"The same with the killing of Muhammad Saddak the Sheik of\nAlbuJlayb tribe, and president of al-Anbar revolutionists, who released statements in\nmosques and markets, promising to eliminate who he called Sheiks of sodomite and thift,\nand agents for the Zionists, like our brother Abu Mustafa Midhatt, our brother Abu\nKhattab, and Sheik Abu al-Harith al-Shar'i, and many others, this vicious organization\n(al-Anbar revolutionists) attempted to assasinate our brother Abu Khudayr, in Ramadi,\nwhen armed men shot him, was injured in the thigh."
0,"Sheik of Albu'Ubaid (Salah al-Dhari), who slaughtered thirty sheeps in one dinner\nparty, where he invited heads and Sheiks of tribes in Ramadi, to encourage their youth to\njoin the police and the national guard, and that's two days before the murder of Sheik\nNasr al-Fahdawi, after that he announced his repentance at the mosque twice infront of\nAlbu'Ubaid tribe, denouncing who joins the police and army, and sorry for all he's done,\nwithout any pressure or threats from the brothers, also the brothers didn't announce the\nclaim for any of the killings."
1,"I case there was a tribe who's not obaying, and their renegade is abvious, the\n    Mujahidin release a statement to expose them, with mass media, then do vicious\n    military operations against them, so they would be a lesson to others."
0,"Sheik of al-Bubali tribe in al-Jazira, Sheik Sarhan, who's one of the traitors, and every\ntime one of their traitors gets killed, he shows outrage and packs his tribe with their guns\nagainst the brothers, after the cleaning in AlbuFahd, the brothers killed three of the spies\nin his tribe, and for the first time there was no reaction against the brothers, but instead he\ncame to them, asking for forgiveness, and he's ready to cooperate."
0,"The same thing exactly happened after the killing of Abu Bilal in Ramadi, the\nmanager of the media office at the Islamic Party as it was announced in some media\nsources, he disallowed and torn any Jihad related posters on the walls, he was caught in\nthe act by the brothers, they beat him and arrested him, he routed out lots of the Party's\nleaders, like Abd al-Ghafur al-Kubaysi, and their conspiracies against the Tanzim (al-\nQa'ida organization), he was ill, got transferred to a hospital where he later died, there\nwere no puplicity to his death by people, expect condemning it by the corrupted satellite\nchannels."
0,"When Mazhar al-`Alawani a candidate for the elections was\nmurdered, his pictures were all over Ramadi, where the entire Albu'Alwan tribe was\nsupporting him, proud of him, one day before the elections, the brothers killed him while\nhe was visiting Ramadi, no one from his tribe openned his mouth, instead they got more\n scared and weaker."
0,The\nbest solution is to cut the head of the snake.
0,"We did not follow this policy until we ran out of time, from past experience\nwhere we let things go, like Kataib al-Hamza (Hamza brigades), and AlbuMahal tribe in\nal-Qaim, where we should've eliminated them then, but what happened happened, also\nMuhsin Abd al-Hamid etc..."
0,At least one other congressman has visited Iraq.

0,"LU_ANNOTATE WC = 196>\n   The Iraqi government blames the embargo for the malnutrition,\ninfant mortality and other hardships."
1,"Ohio Congressman Arrives in Jordan\n<LU_ANNOTATE>\nAMMAN, Jordan (AP)  U.S. Representative Tony Hall arrived in\nJordan on Saturday en route to Iraq, where he is expected to look\ninto the plight of Iraqis after nearly 10 years of U.N. trade\nsanctions."
1,"If supplies are not reaching the people who need them,\nHall said, he wanted to find out whether the United Nations or\nrelief agencies needed to handle things differently, or whether\n""Iraq needs to get out of the way and let us do the job."
0,He said he would pay particular attention to what happens to\nfood and medicine entering the country under the U.N. oil-for-food\nprogram.
0,The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify\nthat Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction and the\nmeans to produce them.
1,"He did not speak to reporters in Jordan, but he told The\nAssociated Press before leaving the United States that he hopes to\n""separate the humanitarian work from the political issues."
0,"Hall, an Ohio Democrat and one of very few U.S. congressmen to\nvisit Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait, is scheduled to\nembark Sunday the 12-hour overland trip to the Iraqi capital,\nBaghdad."
0,So--that's how it\nhappens that in the New York Times piece today I'm\ndescribed--solemnly--as having 'eventually convinced' her to repeat the story\nto the New York Times.
1,But Chatterbox doesn't know any\nother easily understandable phrase that describes this particular kind of\noffense.
1,taunting the rest of the press for not following\nit on the story--and still didn't mention the pardon--it scores an extra\ntwo points.
0,Broaddrick told me Sunday that a Times reporter had appeared\nat the house in the a.m.
0,"She said, 'Well, I'm sorry I didn't."
0,"The Journal editorial page continues not to acknowledge that Norma\nKelsey, the friend and employee to Juanita Broaddrick who is one of two people\npartially corroborating Broaddrick's rape accusation, is the daughter of a man\nwhose murderer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton."
1,"Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus\npoints for having ""eventually convinced"" Broaddrick to grant an interview to\nthe New York Times (as the Times reports in today\'s story)."
1,A responsible account of the\nwhole controversy in today's New York Times reports that Kelsey says the pardon\nhad nothing to do with her corroboration.
1,Which is what Journal news employees are\ninstructed to say whenever the editorial page causes them cringing\nembarrassment.
1,They will then score one point for\nevery subsequent issue or broadcast or Internet posting after the first offense\nis noted by Chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient\nfact--and an additional two points on days when the news organization\nruns a follow-up without making note of said inconvenient fact.
1,Here's how it works: Publications that refuse to acknowledge\n(even if to refute the importance of) highly significant but inconvenient facts\nin their news or opinion coverage of controversial events will score one\npoint for the initial offense.
1,"And besides, Rabinowitz's efforts on the\nTimes ' behalf weren't really unethical, just puzzling, given the two\nnewspapers' intense rivalry."
1,I told her it would be--certainly\nas all right as talking to Dunleavy.
0,"With that in mind, Chatterbox hereby inaugurates the\nIntellectual Dishonesty (henceforth to be known as the Indis )\nIndex ."
1,Publications that get all the way up to 20 will be faxed a likeness\nof Joseph Stalin.
1,"Chatterbox feels\ncertain that the Journal editorial page will provide some follow-up\ntomorrow to tonight's NBC broadcast of its own Broaddrick interview, which\nmeans that if the Journal editorial page continues to take no action it\nwill be in the Indis Hall of Fame by Monday at the latest!"
1,"For the purposes of this survey, the Wall Street Journal will be\ncounted as a separate and distinct publication from the Journal 's\neditorial page, because, in essence, it is."
1,"Chatterbox would prefer not to invoke the phrase\n""intellectual dishonesty,"" because it\'s pompous and falsely suggests that only\nintellectuals can be intellectually dishonest."
1,The Journal editorial page\ngets one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial Op-Ed by\nDorothy Rabinowitz on Feb.
0,She\nsaid Dunleavy caught her by surprise.
0,She\nsaid she would if he called again.
1,"When Chatterbox asked the Journal \'s DC\nbureau chief, Alan Murray, who exercised good judgment in not breaking\nthe Broaddrick story (and--full disclosure-- is Chatterbox\'s former boss), to\ncomment about a Journal employee\'s feeding sources to the Times ,\nhe replied: ""I don\'t really have any comment on what the edit page did."
1,"I asked her why she had decided to talk to the\nNew York Post 's Steve Dunleavy, and refused a Times reporter."
1,"Because it has published three times since the\ninitial omission, it scores an additional three points."
1,Publications receiving a score of 10 will be inducted into the Indis Hall of\nFame .
1,"Even More ""Proving Rape"""
0,But\nthe Scientific Method does not permit any tinkering with the Indis\nIndex 's scoring procedures.
0,"and that she had refused an interview,"" Rabinowitz\nwrites in an e-mail message."
0,She asked if I thought it would be all\nright to talk to the Times reporter.
0,"They do\ntheir thing, we do ours."
1,"Chatterbox feels that the Wall Street Journal editorial page\'s\ncoverage of Juanita Broaddrick\'s rape charges against Bill Clinton (see\n""Proving\nRape ,"" ""More Proving\nRape,"" as well as Michael Kinsley\'s\n""Readme""column in the current issue) cries out for the introduction of the\nScientific Method into the usually mushy business of assessing press\nresponsibility."
0,That comes to a total of six .
1,And because it\npublished an editorial Feb.
1,"For her part, Rabinowitz explains to Chatterbox that her efforts on behalf\nof the Times were more indifferent than the Times made them\nsound."
0,I passed this on to [ Times reporter]\nFelicity Barringer during our second day's interview chat.

0,Don\\Personal\\Letters\nX-Origin: BAUGHMAN-D\nX-FileName: don baughman 6-25-02.PST
1,DID A LOT OF TRAVELING AND THEY (OILSTATES) MADE ME A\nSWEET OFFER TO COME BACK.
0,I LEFT OILSTATES BACK IN MARCH\nWITH ANOTHER COMPANY.
1,WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AMIGO.
0,And we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen.
0,"Whenever we only had one of something she would always say, ""Well, I think the youngest one gets to do it, or wear it or whatever first."
0,"And, that just always stuck in my mind, that in, in our adult life I brought that up to her and she sort of acted like she didn\'t know anything about that and I thought to myself, ""she does,"" and then she laughed about it and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one."
0,"And I just remember that movie was, had a lot of hype about being really scary and suspenseful and it's nothing like these movies that are out today like Scream and, what is it?"
1,"You have to check everything about a movie, check it out to see what the content is and just wasn't like that when I was growing up\n         ."
0,And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie and we would do that.
1,"And Saretha was the counter, would be the same thing as Maid Marion, and, why, again, I don't know why we didn't use Maid Marion."
0,"And there was a scene in the movie I remember where every one of us, and it wasn't just our group, but so many people in the theatre, they screamed out at one time."
1,"Um, Kathy and I also used to play other kind of dress ups and it just, it seems like, I remember we both had like our mother's long skirts, or the skirts would be long on us and we would literally wear dress up clothes that belonged to our mothers."
1,"Which is kind of sad that you can't do that anymore and it's not just because things are, there're bad people in the world but it's too much traffic."
0,And the 2-cent suckers is what is referred to now as a Tootsie Roll Pop.
0,"And when we were, um, little girls we used to play ""Career Girls""!"
0,And there were several different choices.
0,"And it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or, uh, it could be a castle; just do many things with it."
0,"But we had, Kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mother's and I didn't have the necklace."
0,"And that's really all I remember about that night, it was just a lot of fun."
0,We would also drink water.
1,"I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it, was a really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday mornings."
0,"And we would literally time the amount of time, we wore it like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever."
1,"So we only had the one necklace and we, er, we decided, I don't know if it was jointly or if Kathy was just extremely nice of whatever, but she said I could wear it part of the time."
1,"So we went out one night to the movie, but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to, and I think the name of the place was The Open Kitchen, and we didn't have chain pizza places like we do now, like Pizza Hut and all that."
0,"Um, also we did a lot of pretending and as I said we played career girls and the dress ups."
1,"I lived in the Dilworth area, and we would go to the Dilworth Theatre and I do remember that it cost 9 cents to get a ticket to get in."
1,"And when I was young, it wasn't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie."
0,"And in the yard, we had an old tree that had been cut down and just the stump was remaining and my mother had planted, um, flowers all around that stump and we would use that stump as a, as a throne and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her and that would be the throne and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever."
0,So they would fill little bags for us and we would give them a nickel and we could take that to the movie theatre with us.
1,And we went to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we didn't have money to leave tips.
0,"But we, we remained close friends."
1,"And we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up, we sure did; we got an apartment."
1,And then we moved to Charlotte and we used to go to \xef\xbf\xbd and I don't think its even still there I don't know if the building is or not \xef\xbf\xbd but the Dilworth Theatre.
1,"And it was really beautiful and I really, really wanted one."
0,They're going to melt!
0,Did Betty Belle turn Catholic?
1,"In fact we shared an apartment, first apartment either one of us ever had."
0,"And we would go over to my grandparents' and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and, uh, banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch."
1,"We would get maybe 15 cents each to go to the movie, and I sound like I'm 95 years old-"
1,"So it wasn't a good situation for the waitresses, but we had fun and we didn't even think about it."
0,with those kinds of prices.
1,"Um, but we would go to the movie and then you would go in and get your, your snack that you wanted."
0,"But we would switch playing Robin Hood, one would play Robin Hood and one would play Saretha."
1,"And the way we decided who got to wear it first, and this always kind of bothered me because I know Kathy did this intentionally, she said the youngest one got to wear it first and she was like six months younger than I am."
0,"So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in."
0,"Nightmare on Elm Street whatever it is, where they're actual horror movies."
0,"And one particular movie theater we went to, they would show serials every Saturday, which were a continued story."
0,"This was, uh, a real intense, um, drama and, just very scary; kept you on the edge of your seat."
0,"Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time."
0,"And there was one other sucker that cost a nickel and we called that an all day sucker, just because you couldn't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long."
0,So we would go every Saturday morning.
0,Except these were 2 cents because they had the Tootsie Roll in the middle.
1,"And I had a group of girlfriends that I ran around with and there were, golly, there might've been 8 to 10 of us who were good friends."
0,And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this.
0,"And we would, could go to the movie."
0,"So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you, um, wouldn't know what had taken place."
0,We just did what we could get away with.
1,And we didn't even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie.
0,"And I really hope that my daughters have had some nights like that and has had good times like that, that I can remember going out with good friends."
0,"And also at this theater, they gave prizes to different people."
0,"And I just remember seeing, and I was sitting in a middle section, I was not on an end so I had girls I knew on both sides of me."
1,"And one other form of refreshment that we got, which really embarrassed my mother because she didn't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday, there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre."
1,"But for some reason, and I think this is really true, he got ice cream sandwiches!"
0,"And what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking, mistakes."
1,"And one time I can remember, I think it was Steve, my brother, um, he, and they would give treats like candy, I don't even remember what all kinds of prizes the would give."
0,"But we would, uh, buy, lollipops is what they call them now, but we called them suckers and we would get often a 2-cent sucker."
1,We would go into the bakery and we would ask for-\n      \n      \n         \n            \n         \n      \n      \n         -a nickel worth of scraps!
0,And that was another game that Jill and I used to play; we would pretend we were in the jungle and we would climb up on the tree and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephant.
1,"Also about that same time period in my life, I guess again between seven and ten years old, which seems to be what I remember most vividly, my best friend uh, was Kathy Josey, and she was a next door neighbor also, and we remained friends up until, uh, she was about 35 and she passed away with cancer."
1,And that's all the stories I can remember about the movies right now.
0,And the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture.
1,I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre.
0,Like a box of ice cream sandwiches.
1,"Um, and we would, had that many girls but we would only go out in a couple of cars and I remember one of the girls, Betty Belle, her dad had a VW Beetle, and we'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle."
1,"No, I love this story."
0,"And it had real large, thick branches extending out to the side and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches."
0,"So, it, that became\n         a normal thing with us."
1,And of course there's nothing to do with a box of ice cream sandwiches when you're at a 2-hour movie!
0,"Um, and when we were still living in High Point in our back yard we had a huge, I don't know, I guess it was an oak tree, but it was a really big tree, but it was a climbable tree."
1,"But in my mind I can remember playing that, like all day long."
0,"And one of the way they gave prizes was, they would take big group photos and everybody, and there were stairs going up to a balcony, real wide stairs."
0,And they'd take the picture and then you would go back the next Saturday after they had been developed and they would have circled 3 or 4 people in the picture and the people whose head was circled would get the prizes.
1,"I mean, my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back, but today you wouldn't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother; you just wouldn't do it."
0,"And another, um, that was in, that was in High Point, NC."
1,"And my sister and I used to pretend also and Jill is about 2 years younger than I am, maybe two and a half, and we used to play Robin Hood except we didn't have a Maid Marion, we had a Saretha, I don't know where in the world that name came from."
1,And I think I was probably 16 or 17 years old; we were of driving age.
0,And we called them 2-cent suckers because every other sucker cost a penny.
0,"When I was a teenager, an Audrey Hepburn movie came out called Wait Until Dark."
0,I don't ever remember getting popcorn at the movie until I was a teenager or in my adult life.
0,"Everybody had their own ""best"" friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together."
1,This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go.
1,That really happened!
0,Please make an investment in the stability of our community by sending\n      a gift to Goodwill.
1,"March 17, 2000\n      Name Address City, ST, Zip\n      Dear Name:\n      When Jerry was released from prison, he knew it would take hard work\n      and determination to straighten out his life."

0,"Will the\nstrongman of the era be AOL, AT&T, Microsoft, or one of the big media\ncompanies?"
0,Most often reporters recount these tales with each other\nand with their sources rather than share them with the general public.
1,"Out\nin the D.C. area, they looked positively exciting next to all the\ngovernment-oriented contractors."
1,"In any case, there certainly is no lack of information available about the\nmoguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons."
1,That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seem\npossible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire's grip on\nhumanity.
1,"That's ironic, since I\nthink it was just that insularity that helped them, much in the same way that\nAOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon\nValley."
1,I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be\nwritten about this era (probably decades and decades hence as it is too close).
1,I know what you mean about being a journalist.
1,"Much of\nit, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since it\nis largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for some\nvery good stories."
1,"As for\nme, I'll stick with my philosophy of reporting and, I guess, life--nobody\nknows."
1,Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and\nencourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of\nbusinesses where none are allowed to dominate?
1,"I often feel as\nif I only get half the story sometimes, so I typically do a massive amount of\nreporting that is most often much more than I will ever need."
1,"Steve Ballmer, of course, is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft, but\nit still seems to be Bill's show over there."
1,But we all know how that story turned out.
1,"While I did not attend the trial--I was lucky to be able to read your highly\namusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunch\nlaughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and\nthe insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good."
1,I think that is\nwhy I welcomed doing a book--it gives one the ability to use so much of what is\nleft on the cutting room floor of daily journalism.
1,Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we\nnever add to stories.
1,I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company--whether\nit is AOL or Microsoft or Disney--is in charge of all our destinies: Babylon\nwas.
1,"Now I am getting way too philosophical, but this is my final missive, so why\nnot?"
0,So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to\nwatch.
1,The smart-boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully.
1,"I\npersonally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just\none man--at AOL, for example, there was a conscious effort to develop other\n""characters,"" for lack of a better word."
1,"From where I am sitting, I think the Microsoft trial has been the really\nobvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age."
1,The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna
1,"I think it\nalmost does not matter what the judge does since it's clear that the balance of\npower is shifting again, although it not clear where it will land."
1,I would\nposit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the\ncurrent age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur.
0,"So there, while you think of Case, you\nalso think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives."
0,Perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going.
0,Almost every assignment is a\nchallenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier.
1,"I wonder if that means geography is destiny,\nand it's still location, location, location."
1,"AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here, I am sure,\nsince its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati."
0,"We all hear about today's increases in neglect, abuse and abandonment\n      of those who can't fight back: children."
1,"Federal, state and local governments are freezing or withdrawing\n      much-needed funding sources for people who are truly in need."
0,"For some, it's a matter of weeks or months; for others, it's years."
0,We wouldn't exist if\n      the need weren't there.

0,oh all righty i think we know what we're going to speak about um tell you what i'll start off how's that
1,yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months
0,uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there's a jury because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision um what are your feelings
1,um but i think if we quit uh building these Taj Mahals with the color TVs
0,they don't do them real often which is obviously the death penalty
1,uh when there's uh my understanding when there's uh a verdict and it for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth two day in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off
0,in public places there is one state that does that by the way
0,you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a judge that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side
0,and have some judge that was paid off or you know had good a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power
0,uh he was uh he he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay
0,well if i i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from Florida and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really
0,exactly because it's not next day they have the start the trial which is X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more
0,the the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene
1,i want to say Oklahoma i saw report something the other night about it
1,right rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a fortune you know a fortune to keep doing that
1,there's a percentage certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey
0,i think that that if it's if it's not a split decision uh go with the highest number and let's just get on with the program
0,right yeah i heard about that on the news yeah
0,and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution
0,he'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something yeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\texactly\n \t\tyeah yeah i mean you're you're in Dallas so everybody i can't believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence you'd have to be pretty dense\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyou'd be in have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to Lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\toh they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically\n \t\n \t\n \t\tthis is true so true well this has been an interesting conversation\n \t\n \t\tyeah yeah\n \t\twell really this is breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors i mean what can i say no i'm at home with two little kids preschoolers  my husband works for TI\n \t\n \t\n \t\toh so you're at the house you're not at the plant\n \t\toh hold it\n \t\toh that's good that's good i thought i heard a holler there in the background but i wasn't sure\n \t\n \t\n \t\tso yeah\n \t\toh yeah i've got the dog and two kids waiting here i am locked up in the laundry room  okay thanks a lot bye-bye\n \t\n \t\n \t\toh goodness well i'll let you get i enjoyed it bye
0,all right Amy how are you doing today
1,um i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back
1,um kind of gets back to the second request we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict the a situation like that i'd say no let's just go like a regular vote eight to four tells me that there were eight
0,it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know that have on a list are the ones that are on the jury and that's it
1,i mean there are so many just major major serial murders and it's not just like one instance or something it's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on
0,the old Charles Manson case i mean the guy is really
0,but i also i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know
1,you know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know what's his whim to decide it should be two months
0,yeah yeah i get back to Price's comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break you know
0,you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway i don't know if it prevents it but  seems like the jury system does have it's advantages
1,and sixty dollars sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with and let's just screwing up the system uh
0,and i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group it's not just random people
1,so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really
1,just shouldn't be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge
1,yeah and the yeah there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um
0,because they just say there's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them or
1,life in prison then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole so what you know let's quit BSing with the system
0,this is true and and and and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to
1,well even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for starving children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than tha

0,"But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is, where do values come from at all?"
0,"Indeed, Hume' s injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements."
0,Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible.
0,"In short, once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum, it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere."

0,"This enlarged shared world gives us more know-how, and more know that."
1,"I do not disagree, although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self-organization in evolution."
1,The know-how is the propagating organization.
0,"It seems hard to ascribe purpose, in the sense of acting on its own behalf, to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga."
0,"And again without attributing consciousness, once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present?"
0,Consider first the famous genetic code.
0,"The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest, the athletic genius high jumping, have the know-how to do it."
0,"Semantics\nAll of which brings us, inevitably, to the brink of semantics."
1,Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can  ``know that''  with respect to propositions.
0,"Because of this, which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging, plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA."
0,"It is simple at its roots, you see."
0,"But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner, that sequence of events seems laden with semantics."
0,"Dennett distinguishes  ``Darwinian creatures,''   ``Pavlovian creatures,''   ``Popperian creatures,''  and  ``Gregorian creatures."
0,"Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful, philosophers as famous as G. E. Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances."
0,"Here, in Investigations, I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy, detect those sources of energy, create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy, and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further."
0,"In turn, the second  ``anti-idiotype''  antibody stimulates a third, which stimulates a fourth."
0,Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing.
0,"The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system."
0,"If not, then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamics  perhaps a set of water-filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways."
1,"We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context, but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents."
0,"This is no criticism, and is widely known and appreciated."
1,"Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli, or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future, I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around."
1,"Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our tools  literally stone knives, arrows, digging sticks, machine tools  to enlarge our shared world of facts and processes."
0,"This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus, but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter."
0,"If so, can  ``mere chemicals''  be signs in the full Piercean sense?"
0,But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view?
0,Know that is a thin veneer on a four-billion-year-old know-how skill abundant in the biosphere.
0,Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent.
1,"Yet, I persistently hope, it is better to light one candle against   ."
1,I cannot buy Shannon' s view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent.
1,"But autonomous agents, we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom  ``intentionality''  and  ``purpose''  are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous agents, also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties."
1,"Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier, yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics, intentionality, value, and ethics arise with autonomous agents."

0,The 1993 documentary The War Room captures some of his efforts on\ntape.
1,"When Democrats\nwonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton, they don't need to look much\nfurther than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos, Carville (and\na cooperative campaign press corps) helped to put over in 1992."
1,I guarantee you that\nif you do this you'll never work in Democratic politics again.
1,"Clinton has no character problem,"" Stephanopoulos declares."
1,"Near the end of The War Room, Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone\nwho apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours, which he is about to\npublicize."
1,These are probably the most serious allegations yet\nleveled against the president.
1,Stephanopoulos\nwants to run for the Senate and doesn't want to seem a Clinton stooge.
1,"Dick Morris, Marv Albert)\nrebound too quickly in our celebrity culture."
1,"Political figures turn on each other\nfrom time to time, for good and bad reasons; we're used to it."
1,Stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going\nthrough the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the\ncountry.
1,"He said he had problems in his marriage,"" says Stephanopoulos,\ncorrecting Donaldson\'s deviation from the pre-scripted fudge-phrase of the day."
1,But usually at least a nanosecond\nof contrition is required.
1,"Again, he's not a fool."
1,"During the 1992 campaign, when Gennifer Flowers first brought\nClinton's philandering to public attention, Stephanopoulos--as Clinton's chief\nspinner, distracter, and all-around bullshit artist--played a crucial role in\ndiscrediting Flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth, namely\nthat Clinton had a disturbing zipper problem."
1,Is Chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even\ndisgusting about Stephanopoulos' eager show of independence from the president?
1,"Early in the film, with the Flowers crisis in full bloom, Sam Donaldson\ninterviews Stephanopoulos, who blames it all on the ""Republican attack\nmachine."
1,"There was former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos on ABC\'s This\nWeek this morning, furrow-browed and ""heartbroken with all the evidence\ncoming out"" against the president."
1,The problem isn't so much his disloyalty.
1,"There's no question that, if they're true, they\n..."
1,Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping\nquiet.
1,You would be laughed at ...
1,Stephanopoulos Analyzes His Own Crime
1,"By\nlending credence to the Lewinsky charges, and treating Clinton's familiar\ndefenses as the lies and half-lies they seem to be, Stephanopoulos shows he's\nnot a fool."
1,Don't say Stephanopoulos didn't\nknow.
1,You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander-protection\ntechniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability to\nnot get caught.
1,"It's as if Roy Cohn went on television in the mid-'50s to soberly rue the\ndamage wreaked by Sen. Joe McCarthy, without any apology for his own role."
1,"Today, of course, the president's defenders claim that Clinton admitted\ninfidelity on 60 Minutes and that the fully informed voters simply\ndidn't care."
1,Much\nhas been made of the way famous wrongdoers (e.g.
1,"He was one of Clinton's principal enablers, to use a word\nemployed by Maureen Dowd in today's New York Times ."
1,The trouble is that Stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in\nthe first place.
1,could lead to impeachment proceedings.
1,"If Clinton, as is now increasingly clear, was a time bomb waiting to\nexplode, then Stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the White House and\nmuffled the ticking."
1,"Simply put, Stephanopoulos did as much as any\nman to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments."
1,"Last week, when the Lewinsky story was only\na few hours old, Stephanopoulos popped up on Good Morning America to\ndemonstrate his concern."
1,Donaldson suggests that on 60 Minutes Clinton had admitted to\ninfidelity.

1,McCoy has only one interest:\n      the well being of Marion County's young people.

1,We believe there\n      is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative\n      effort to financially support the services MCCOY offers to the community\n      as a whole.
0,"For the past three years, MCCOY has been actively engaged in\n      accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others:\n      youth service providers, youth, funding bodies, and interested citizens\n      to name a few."

1,Youth who are supported and\n      encouraged by both a family and a society that values\n      \n      Them have a much greater likelihood of becoming productive and\n      contributing members of adult society.
1,"Since its re-organization, MCCOY has established its unique niche\n      within the community by refraining from direct service programming and\n      focusing on what it does best: helping to identify youth needs, convening\n      groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs,\n      and moving toward collaborative solutions."
1,"The formation of The Community Academy, a pilot project\n      directed at expelled students from local school systems, has come about\n      as a result of MCCOY's efforts to mobilize community agencies in response\n      to a pressing issue."

0,and and it's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go out into the public and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work
1,that's true or the ones that are are generated by a computer it's just a computer voice that comes on the line those are the ones that i really really hate too
0,and i can't remember what it was
0,i'm drawing the blank
1,they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything
0,that's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences
1,and take it easy now good night
1,and um gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too it wasn't even what i would consider you know a family hour it's time to you know start going to bed and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
1,yeah yeah yeah that's true that's true
1,what i would love to see done to stop all of this
1,um-hum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand
0,uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there's people coming around you know and they're trying to sell something or or they're from a religious organization
1,and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own
1,that was the big one i'm talking about i work weird hours
1,now i agree with their right to um
1,i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have guessed i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get
1,yeah yeah no i i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in and and i don't like the way that they do it either
1,but you know i don't think that that would stop people i mean it's like they they see that word and it says uh go
0,have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they're either
1,i believe we've pretty much summed everything up
0,they're introducing some new product in the area and
1,and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly care for it so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me
1,or you hear somebody already starting reading reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already
1,uh-huh uh-huh yeah sometimes i i get them on my uh answering machine at home so and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them aren't from anybody at all
1,i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything
1,uh pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you
1,and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door
0,you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else
1,a harassment in itself
1,even had some of them the
1,and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
1,yeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations
1,i agree with you on that particular subject there
1,well it was nice talking to you too Jim
1,oh goodness okay is our five minutes up
1,i put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people
1,peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their salesman salesman to come out
1,wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment
1,but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them
1,but i consider invasion of my privacy
1,now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in
0,and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the click as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on
1,pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
1,and i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at all and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations
0,and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago
0,that is that one that you were talking about
1,normally when they call you're either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone
1,i'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them otherwise i don't want to know they exist
0,offering a service or
1,so yeah i do i really feel that that's uh an invasion of my privacy
0,we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted
1,yeah yeah that's true yeah no i don't uh i don't have i didn't go that far but uh yeah i probably could do the same thing uh you know i don't have a storm door but i'm sure i could rig up something

1,"Taiwan ""would not stand idly by"" because ""the attacks were not only a challenge to the US but also a disruption of peace for mankind,"" Chen said in a statement released by the presidential office."
1,"Chen's remarks came as the US was massing forces to launch reprisals against Afghanistan, where the prime suspect Usama bin Laden is believed to be in hiding."

0,"It is in this key that we are conducting a dialogue with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders."""
1,"After Israel seized the ship, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon demanded the arrest of the Palestinian officials who, the Israelis claim, were behind the attempt to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip."
1,"""It is necessary now to find out the truth about the ship which was carrying weapons to be smuggled, and punish those guilty,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Saltanov told Interfax."

1,"Irabini said he explained to them that Misuari was being held for rebellion, and not because ""he was a Muslim, a member of the Bangsamoro people or an MNLF leader."""

1,"As this developed, the number of lawyers who will defend Misuari grew to 28, after former Davao City Mayor Benjamin de Guzman and two others agreed to serve as his counsel."
1,"""If the government was able to extend amnesty to our Christian brothers, like (former renegade Army officer Gregorio) ""Gringo"" Honasan and others, why can\'t it accord the same privilege to Chairman Misuari?"" Rasul asked"
1,"Iribani said he explained to the Muslim leaders that Misuari's personal demands, including access to the media, could not be granted because these were not within his rights as a detainee."
1,Local Government Assistant Secretary Abraham Iribani called on Saturday for sobriety among Muslim leaders and Moro National Liberation Front commanders amid alleged attempts by certain groups to start a religious war over Misuari's detention.
0,The local government official held a dialogue with the Muslim leaders to officially report to them Misuari's status and answer their questions about his arrest and detention.
1,The deportation of Misuari by Malaysia also drew flak from opposition legislators who warned that it could trigger a reaction in the government's peace efforts.
1,Rasul said they could not understand why the government was so hard on Misuari when it was lenient with other leaders who revolted in the past.
1,"Rasul told Radio Mindanao Network here that some 1,000 members of the Misuari force have been on standby and are prepared to spring their leader from detention in Sta. Rosa, Laguna, at anytime."
1,"MacArthur Rasul, who claims to be a spokesperson of Misuari's Mutallah Force, said the group was just waiting for orders to mount the rescue operation."

1,"Aside from the sensitive legal questions, Pimentel said there is a growing impression that Misuari could pose a security threat to the country."
1,"""We should remain calm and let the law take its course,"" Iribani, designated government spokesperson for Misuari\'s case, said he told a group of Muslim leaders and MNLF commanders in a dialogue in Zamboanga City."
0,"""Our field commanders are just waiting for orders from the higher hierarchy,"" Rasul said."
1,"Some Moro groups had claimed Misuari\'s detention was an affront to the Muslim people and should be cause for a ""Muslim war."""
1,"Misuari's other lawyers warned yesterday the country's judicial system, more than their client, will be on trial because of the legal nuances surrounding his arrest."
1,"""I told them the act of rebellion happened in public and the charges were not just fabricated,"" Iribani said in a phone interview."
1,"Rasul admitted, however, that even if there was a strong desire among Misuari's followers to free him, the plan would fail if the jailed rebel leader went against it."
1,Iribani also dismissed reports that renegade MNLF commanders were plotting to stage bomb attacks in Mindanao and Metro Manila to protest Misuari's arrest.
1,"Maguindanao Rep. Didagen Dilangalen said the prosecution of Misuari for rebellion could force the government to revive the cases against other rebel leaders, particularly of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the National Democratic Front."
1,"De Guzman said it was lawyer Macapanton Abbas Jr. who asked him, former vice mayor Dominador Zuno Jr. and city councilor Victorio Advincula to join the team of lawyers that would defend Misuari in court."
1,COTABATO CITY - An alleged member of Nur Misuari's elite force said Saturday there is a plan to rescue their jailed leader.
1,"""That\'s not true,"" he said."
1,"As for the intifadah's infrastructure, it has actually widened and turned into volcanoes that are boiling with rage."
1,"Most importantly, however, these criminals will have the largest illusion if they imagine that they have succeeded in liquidating the intifadah and destroying its infrastructure after having succeeded in liquidating or arresting a small or large number of the intifadah's leaders and strugglers"
1,"In addition, they seek to convince other parties of these two ideas and are waiting for the concerned parties to agree to them, or, at least, to the first one, after which these two administrations will set their own conditions at the table."
1,This reconstruction will take place more quickly than what the criminals in Tel Aviv and Washington think.
1,"All this is one thing, but the Palestinian people's will is something different."
1,"The real victor in this battle is, in fact, the Palestinian people and not the Zionists."
1,It is thus an illusion for these criminal administrations to imagine that they have triumphed and that they are now in a position to dictate their own conditions on this great people.
1,"The conclusion to which we come is that the Zionist and US administrations have aggravated the Zionist entity\'s historical impasse through the crime they have committed together when they had the illusion that ""force"" can break the Palestinian people\'s will and impose on this people what other means failed to impose."
1,"These criminals know this fact, as much as we, the Arabs, do, because they are in direct contact with it."
1,"It is also true that thousands of Palestinians and their leaders are held hostage, and that the entire Palestinian people are now experiencing the utmost suffering as part of their daily lives."
1,"For many reasons, the occupation of Palestinian towns cannot last, so the Zionist forces will have to withdraw from these towns sooner or later."
1,"Therefore, the two administrations, from the position of a ""victor,"" have called for an international or regional peace conference."
1,They have also announced that President Yasir Arafat is no longer fit for the coming phase.
1,"In addition, it is now more impossible than ever to control the movement of three million Palestinians."
1,"As has been acknowledged by Uri Avneri, a veteran Zionist writer, the intifadah\'s structure ""exists within millions of Palestinians and also within tens of millions of Arabs in whose chests the fire of anger is blazing."""
1,"The Zionists have succeeded in achieving these things, but a deep-rooted fact is that they have not succeeded, and will never succeed, in breaking the will of this valiant people or in forcing the Palestinians into relinquishing their just, legitimate rights and ending their glorious struggle for these rights."
1,The Zionist and US administrations have the illusion that they succeeded in defeating the Palestinian people and their valiant intifadah.
1,"As for the towns and refugee camps that have been destroyed, they will soon be reconstructed by the Palestinian people who have skillfully adapted themselves to the most difficult circumstances."
1,"Millions of Arabs, Palestinians and non-Palestinians alike, now have a conviction stronger than before to the effect that it is impossible to achieve ""coexistence"" with this usurping, occupying, aggressive, and racist entity."
1,Another deep-rooted fact is that the organizations of the Palestinian resistance still preserve their organizational structure and are also characterized by their superb ability to renew their leaders and replace the ones who fall along the path of martyrdom.
1,"Contrary to the visible scene and to the illusion of Sharon and Bush, this Zionist-US crime has confirmed that the Zionist entity\'s historical impasse is constantly aggravating and that ""the Arabs\' recognition of this entity\'s right to exist"" is now more distant than before despite some official Arab ""recognitions."""
1,"He added: ""If more fighters and martyrdom-seeking ones fall, other fighters and martyrdom-seeking ones will emerge, who are ready to follow in their footsteps."""
1,This is actually one of the deep-rooted facts.
1,"It is true that the Palestinian towns are now under occupation, that the Palestinian Authority's institutions have been destroyed, and that Arafat is still besieged at his office as a hostage."
1,"In its warnings and appeals for peace, the United States openly ""takes a side"" in this conflict, labeling the other side terrorists, similar to those who carried out the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York."
1,"It is worrying that among Powell's priorities in Beirut were the talks on the activities of the Hezbolah, with an announcement that terrorists might open a new front."
1,"It would be entirely improper if, in its defense of Israel, the United States continues to exert pressure on neighboring Arab countries, such as, Syria and Lebanon, which have been accused of supporting terrorist organizations, such as the Hezbolah."
1,"But the current development of events, that is, the standstill situation, makes it clear that US foreign policy has been put to a very serious test in which the United States needs to discipline its decades-long ally, Israel, and not ruin its relations with the Arabs."
0,Another round of talks will be held today between Powell and the chief players in the Middle East.
1,"His task was to create ""a peaceful environment"" in the region currently affected by an unrecognized and undeclared war between Israel and Palestine."
1,"With an average $3 billion military aid for Israel and a strong Jewish lobby at home, the Untied States cannot play any other role in the Middle East conflict but protector of the Israeli state."
1,"In the same manner Israel asked Arafat to leave Ramallah and Palestine, labeling him a troublemaker and politician incapable of controlling the Palestinian suicide bombers."
1,The international community received a lot of negative points for the Middle East.
1,"Maybe Joschka Fischer's plan for suspending Germany's military aid for Israel, that is, possible EU economic sanctions against Tel Aviv is honorable, but it is a late and disturbingly long-term plan."
1,"In relation to the first ambiguity, Powell's words definitely cannot be taken seriously, considering that precisely Washington is the one that has been practicing a one-sided approach to the events in the Middle East for 18 months now and it was the chief opponent of the positioning of peace troops between the two warring sides."
1,"The man who defeated Iraq in 1991 in only six weeks issued a message, saying that the most he hoped for was something less than a mutual cease-fire agreement."
1,"The impression is that, under US sponsorship, the international community deliberated too long about the violence in the Middle East."
1,"In some circles, these concerns over an alleged new front are seen as an attempt to resolve the smaller Israel-Palestine problem with a bigger one."
1,"The EU's efforts and US President Bush's peace initiative through Secretary of State Powell seem like a late resolution, considering that approximately one month ago the Arab countries participating in the summit in Beirut held out an olive branch to Israel through the plan of Saudi Arabia's heir to the throne, Prince Abdullah, which contained two points: recognition of a Palestinian state [as published] in an Arab neighborhood, in return for recognition of the Palestinians' right to their own country."
1,The latest round of violence was initiated on the day in September 2000 when Ariel Sharon took it upon himself to provoke his Muslim neighbors by visiting an Islamic religious building.
1,"Sharon, who used to be a colonel and who is directly responsible for the massacre in the Beirut camps Sabra and Shatila, used his return to power as an opportunity to settle the accounts with his years-long enemies."
1,"For example, a new Israeli-Arab war."
1,"Israel did not even have the goodness to look at this plan, demonstrating arrogance toward everything Arab."
1,"The hero of the Gulf War, Colin Powell, did not exactly cover himself in glory in his diplomatic mission to the Middle East as the US president's envoy."
1,"Powell\'s words, ""we are working on this plan,"" are unclear, because he did not say what the plan is, and Israel\'s call for a conference on the Middle East is also unclear."
1,"Europe does not have a united stance on the violence in Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem, and the Palestinian refugee camps, despite the clear situation that Israel is the only country in the world that secures its borders by occupying territories of another state."

1,"She added: ""Venezuela designs its own policies in an autonomous manner and, in any event, it is up to Venezuelans to decide them."
1,"The deputy said that Powell's remarks did not surprise him and added that the US official's opinion is based on reports published by the domestic and international press, which is waging a ruthless war against the Venezuelan chief of state."

1,"Last Tuesday, before the US Senate\'s Foreign Policy Committee, Powell voiced his concern over ""several actions by President Chavez and his ideas of what is a democratic system."""
1,It has been vague about Venezuela's intentions regarding the protection of crude prices and the war on terrorism.
1,"However, he did explain that he is more concerned about reports that Venezuela has relations with organizations categorized as terrorist by the Bush administration than he is about Powell's statement."
1,"Noheli Pocaterra, vice president of the National Assembly, stressed that it is up to Venezuela to decide its foreign policy and the United States must respect its decision."
1,"He also criticized the visits by the chief of state to countries that are on the black list of supporters of terrorism, published by the administration of President George W. Bush, including Cuba, Libya, and Iraq."
1,[Caracas El Nacional (Internet version) in Spanish on 7 February carries a related 760-word item that says that some opposition deputies agreed that the government's tactless actions are to blame for the concerns voiced by US Foreign Secretary Colin Powell.
1,"However, he ruled out that the statement by the US Foreign Secretary will lead to a change in the policies of President Chavez."
1,"He argued: ""When the United States has faced a situation involving extremist groups holding hostages, they have sent intermediaries to negotiate and no one has said that this shows they have relations with those groups."""
1,"According to Fermin, the chief of state still does not understand that if there is no confidence, there will be no investments."
1,MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno went even further and established a direct relation between the concerns voiced by the Secretary of State and the disclosure of a video that presumably confirms relations between the Venezuelan Government and the Colombian rebel groups.
1,"It should have worked to eliminate injustice, instead of trying to harass other countries for national prejudices."
1,"The lumping of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' by President Bush has certainly not raised US image."
1,"It has rather tarnished it, since the international community expects a mature, compassionate and civilised conduct from the United States as the only superpower in the world."
1,NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson said in New York that credible evidence will be prerequisite for NATO's support for any military action against the three nations.

1,Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that Bush has made a 'big mistake' by lumping the three nations together as they are different from each other.
1,Its unfettered support to Israel is based on injustice and this distortion in its policies needs to be removed to ensure its own security as well as that of its allies.
1,"President Bush is intolerant to the dissent to his policy of domination in total negation of the lofty principles of morality, ethic and democracy, which he assertively holds so dear to his heart."
1,Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said after meeting US Vice President Dick Cheney in Washington that there is no evidence of weapons' proliferation against these nations to substantiate the US charge.
1,Fight against poverty alone will not be a productive effort to fight terrorism.
1,French officials said that the rhetoric of good and evil is not suitable for the realities of today's world.
1,It's injustice that breeds hatred and revolt.
1,"Washington is, in fact, treading a path of coercion, intimidation and blackmailing against the smaller and weaker nations."
1,"If terrorism is to be fought successfully, the United States should better withdraw its support to the forces of injustice, tyranny and oppression in the world."
1,"The world expects a civilised conduct from the United States in place of arrogance, discrimination and injustice."
1,"It should have been on the side of the smaller and weaker nations, rather than targeting them one by one in the pursuit of its global agenda."
1,"President Bush's projection of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' and his threat of military action against them has evoked world-wide criticism."
1,That statement immediately caused extensive controversy.
1,"The other day, Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov said: ""It is unacceptable to Russia to mechanically extend the scope of antiterrorist action to any country, including Iraq."""
1,"It was brutal and reeked of blood, turning the whole world upside down."
1,"However, even if they did have this kind of weapons, who would dare to use them against the United States, the world's number one nuclear nation, either directly or indirectly through terrorists, while risking the danger of being completely annihilated?"
1,Their cause was an unjust one and therefore had little support.
1,"As to whether or not they have developed weapons of mass destruction, all three countries have denied it, but the United States does not believe them."
1,"At present, very few in the international community have responded in favor of the theory of ""evil axis,"" because many countries, including China, have made clear their stand against willful expansion of the war against terror."
1,"It seems that the market for the theory of ""evil axis"" is still limited."
1,"That is why many people suspect the purpose of the United States\' putting Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK in the box of ""evil axis"" is to prepare public opinion for possible strikes against these old foes under the banner of fighting terror."
1,"That being the case, why has the only superpower in today\'s world insisted that they are the new ""axis of evil?"""
1,"But so far, there has been no conclusive evidence indicating that the government of any of them was involved in the ""11 September"" incident of terrorist attacks that happened in the United States last year."
1,"Moreover, Iran made a clear stand in support of the war against terror after the incident."
1,"According to President Bush, all these three countries ""sponsor terrorism"" and attempt to ""develop weapons of mass destruction."""
1,"In fact, even the US ally, Britain, and other Western countries have indicated that the antiterrorist military action should be conducted with restraint, for otherwise the danger of losing control will emerge."
1,The answer should be negative.
1,"Quite on the contrary, these three are all developing nations and have experienced slow economic development because of sanctions imposed by the West, so there is no chance of them boosting their military strength significantly."
1,"Actually, these three countries do have one common denominator, i.e., that their values and polices do not agree with those of the United States and none of them are on good terms with the United States."
1,"It goes without saying that the three countries mentioned reacted strongly to it and other countries also found it very abrupt, so they all started trying to decipher the message within."
1,"They were destined to collapse, disintegrate, and meet with a total failure; their reputation was ruined in historical records; and they earned eternal notoriety."
1,"In particular, Iran and Iraq are at loggerheads with each other to this day."
1,"In terms of strength, these three countries cannot be mentioned in the same breath as Germany, Italy, and Japan in the 1940's."
1,"Obviously, the ""title"" of ""axis"" is something in international relations that every country would do anything to avoid, so Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK naturally want to clean themselves of the dirty water that someone else have thrown on them."
1,That military alliance was powerful and constantly on a quest of expansion.
1,"Beijing, 3 Feb (Xinhua)-- In his recent State of the Union address, US President Bush quite unexpectedly labeled Iran, Iraq, and the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea [DPRK] as an ""axis of evil."""
1,"At the mention of the word ""axis,"" one would inevitably be reminded of the military alliance formed by fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan during World War II in the 1940\'s."
1,"Furthermore, the Russian side has stressed time and time again that the United States' accusations against Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK should be settled within the UN framework and raised objections to any hostile action against these three countries without authorization from the Security Council."
1,"Does an ""axis of evil"" really exist in today\'s world?"

1,"For example, most of these groups have long urged the formation of an independent electoral commission to take charge of the preparations and conduct of the ballot, but are now reluctantly willing to accommodate Mugabe's partisan Electoral Supervisory Commission."
1,"What is South African President Thabo Mbeki's point when he says the SADC must ensure that Zimbabwe has a free election when, as he knows, nothing practical is being done by the regional body to ensure that Mugabe indeed complies?"
1,"For example, the EU and the SADC - as all others - must refuse to send observers if these are not allowed to be on the ground by the end of this week or early next week at the very latest."
1,"What is clear - if this was not so obvious all along to some of these organisations - is that nothing whatsoever will deter Mugabe from doing anything and everything to claim victory in the ballot, however fraudulent."
1,"And as all must now know - Mbeki included - Mugabe has no chance at all of winning any ballot that is free from intimidation and violence, notwithstanding his desperate last-minute act to try to buy votes using the hurried land reforms."
1,"These bodies have long called for the deployment of independent election observers, both Zimbabwean and international, and yet none are in place even a few weeks before the polls."
1,"A YEAR after gently attempting to nudge Zimbabwe's government into embracing minimum conditions that allow for a free and fair presidential election, several local and international groups find themselves back to square one, unable to move the Harare authorities even an inch."
1,"Even by the EU's own submissions just two weeks ago, its international observers - and not pliant ones handpicked by the government to validate a sham - should have been on the ground by now, but the 15-nation bloc is still talking to Harare!"
1,"So have been attempts by Zimbabwe's civic bodies such as the Crisis Group, the National Constitutional Assembly, well-meaning churches such as the Roman Catholics and even the so-called National Economic Consultative Forum."
1,"Several diplomatic missions from organisations such as the European Union (EU), the Commonwealth, the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and Africa's powerhouse Nigeria have come and gone from Harare empty-handed."
1,Therefore the time to stop this tragic circus - many would say madness - is either now or never.
1,"It follows therefore that all these groups must reject in advance the fraud that is being staged under the guise of an election, unless Mugabe urgently meets all the minimum conditions that allow for a semblance of a free and fair ballot."
1,"For the EU and the Commonwealth, which are due to meet shortly, they should realise that they are running out of meaningful options to influence the course of events in Zimbabwe."
1,Either the EU and the SADC - as indeed all others - take meaningful action now that will move the Harare authorities or they forever hold their peace.
1,What is the point of engaging in dialogue with a government that is only interested in buying time while it fervently escalates a campaign of bludgeoning its citizens in the hope of frightening voters into supporting Mugabe?
1,"Predictably, their advice has fallen on stones because, whatever their suggestions, Mugabe could not care less, interested only in retaining power at any cost."
1,"In their own ways, these groups have sought dialogue rather than confrontation to prod President Robert Mugabe to see reason and put his nation first and not to embark on the suicidal path that he has chosen."

1,"""Terrorists believe that anything goes in the name of their cause"", said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch."
1,The willingness of most western governments to tolerate abuses by friendly governments in the Middle East and North Africa has tended to undermine the growth of a human rights culture there.

1,"Amidst the heat of military battles in Afghanistan, and on the background of the double crime that hit the United States, international opinion is now willing to overlook some inhumane practices that were made on this or that front."

0,"As prisoners from Al-Qa'ida and Taliban are being transported to the cells of the US Guantanamo base in Cuba, the United States' war on terrorism enters a new stage that is completely different from that of armed confrontation in Afghanistan."
1,"This has prompted two of Washington\'s closest allies, Britain and Australia, to express their ""concern"" over the way the prisoners were transported from Afghanistan and the way they are being treated in captivity."
1,"As the campaign of Western criticism of the United States heightens, it has become urgent for Washington to clarify its stand on treating the prisoners and their destiny so that it would not be recorded in history that the number one democracy in the war won the war on terrorism in weeks and lost the reputation of commitment to principles of human justice that it took centuries to gain."

0,"Participants in the meeting included Afghan interim administration chairman Hamid Karzai, US State Secretary Colin Powell, US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and World Bank President James Wolfensohn."
1,Proof of that is the refusal to treat the 110 detainees in Guantanamo and the hundreds held in Afghanistan as prisoners of war.
1,"The official explanations - they had just got off the plane, the masks are for fear of spreading tuberculosis, they are dangerous - hardly ring true, they discredit the USA and would seem to confirm the prevalent assumption in many allied countries that the superpower has decided to wage war and administer justice all on its own."
1,"In the event of disagreement, as is the case now, with the USA insisting that the issue concerns terrorists who do not belong to any state and who do not have rights as prisoners, the final decision should be left in the hands of ""an appropriate tribunal"", which must be impartial and independent, as Article 5 of the third Geneva Convention states."
1,"Thanks to their efforts and to pressure from allied governments, notably the British government, the commandant at Guantanamo has now allowed the Red Cross into the base with the freedom to interview as many detainees as they please."
1,"The sooner the inhumane treatment of detainees is put to a end, the better."
1,"The fact that the photographs have been distributed to the press voluntarily by the US authorities would suggest that they aren't even aware of what they are doing or, worse still, that they don't care."
1,"As Amnesty International has pointedly remarked, the photographs of the detainees in Guantanamo that the US army has unashamedly seen fit to release are reminiscent of the torture centres of eastern Europe in the Cold War."
1,"""They\'re terrorists, they\'re murderers and the USA will treat them as it pleases,"" is Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld\'s reply to the critics."
1,"It's a step in the right direction, but it's only the start."
1,"Holding detainees in handcuffs and shackles is not acceptable in a democracy, nor is depriving them of all their senses by putting blindfolds over their eyes, surgical masks over their mouths and noses, and gloves on their hands to disorientate them and subject them to sensory deprivation."
1,"Spanish daily urges USA to end ""inhumane treatment"" of Al-Qa\'idah suspects"
1,"Fortunately, not everyone in the Bush administration is of the same opinion."
1,"Even before these pictures [were released], Human Rights Watch had described the 1.8 by 2.4 metre cages where the prisoners are held as scandalous."

1,Australia has already said it would prefer a civil trial or an international tribunal.
1,"According to the US administration, they can be tried outside US territory before secret military courts and they can be condemned, even to death, without the assurance of having been found guilty ""beyond all reasonable doubt""."
1,A court-martial according to the usual procedure would have guaranteed them a much sturdier legal defence.
1,"Humanitarian organizations, however, believe that the Geneva Convention can be applied to these prisoners and that it states that they must be treated humanely and be subject to other rights in the place that has been baptized ""Camp X-Ray"", in allusion to the building of the covered sheds with barbed wire in place of walls [that house the prisoners]."
1,"It so happens that among the detainees taken to Guantanamo there are three British nationals, an Australian and various Saudis, amongst others."
1,"It may be the moment to offer the world's television channels, from CNN to Qatar's Al-Jazeera, full access [to the camp]."
1,"Guaranteeing justice in the way we perceive it, even for the possible promoters of terrorism, is a question of principles that impedes, among other things, comparisons with the regime on the other side of the fence to the US base."
1,"It is an idea that could be worked on, especially since, in contrast to the fate of those held at the Cuban base, John Walker, the 20-year-old US ""convert"" to the Taleban being held in Afghanistan, will be tried with the full protection of the law by a civil court in the USA and, at the moment, stands accused of crimes that do not carry the death penalty, although they could put him in jail for life."
1,Perhaps this is why Fidel Castro has not spoken out against what might go on in Guantanamo.
1,"A team from the International Red Cross is interviewing each of more than 100 Taleban and Al-Qa'idah members being held prisoner in Guantanamo about the treatment they are receiving, a situation that Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has said does not interest him."
1,"Everyone should be given the same opportunities and protection before the law so, by the same token, suspected members of Al-Qa'idah being held in Europe, whose numbers have risen in recent days, will be tried by civil courts, including in Spain."
1,"If the Bush administration is stubborn enough to persist with this attitude, it could cause a rift with a European public opinion that showed only solidarity and generosity after the terrorist attacks of 11 September."
1,"It could also alienate itself from a large part of its allies, even if, militarily speaking, Washington is conducting its campaign in virtual isolation."
1,The US Association of Legal Professionals is of the opinion that these military tribunals cannot pass sentence on any crimes other than those derived from violations of the right to war.
1,The Geneva Convention rules that prisoners must be freed or repatriated after the hostilities have ended.
1,"The emergency legislation carried through in the wake of 11 September means that the USA does not see these detainees from Afghanistan as prisoners of war to be treated according to the Geneva Convention, whose 1997 protocol it has yet to sign, but as ""unlawful combatants"", or ""people arrested on the battlefield""."
1,Spanish daily warns USA its treatment of suspects could alienate allies
1,"A clear contradiction of this situation is the fact that, in response to a terrorist action, Washington has gone to war in Afghanistan, even if it hasn't officially declared war on the country."
1,"The USA's credibility will be tarnished if it allows the prisoners captured in Afghanistan and transferred to Guantanamo, the naval base it holds in Cuba, to face military courts without any guarantee whatsoever of a fair trial."

1,The changes made by Chavez in his team expose the cracks in the coalition.
1,Half the active population is in the informal economy.
1,"The noise from the pots and pans does a poor job of hiding the opposition's desire to launch a kind of civil disobedience, an indication that Venezuela has finally entered a dangerous stage."
1,"It was to be expected that the new laws--a consequence of the economic crisis--would have different effects on the union leaders, radical left-wing politicians, and populist militants represented in the government."
1,"The electoral path followed by Chavez when his attempt at an open coup failed may now be the aperitif for the probable ""democratic coup"" that is being prepared from the inside out."
1,Venezuela's economic situation forms a wretched background for the ideological experiments of the Bolivarian Constitution that Chavez got approved by plebiscite.
1,"From election to election and plebiscite to plebiscite, Venezuela is moving rapidly toward a ""legal coup"" that may be the logical consequence of the clashes inside Miraflores Palace."
1,"As the opposition raises its head, the climate of plots takes shape."
1,"Those laws affect almost everything in the country, from petroleum to land ownership."
1,Over $200 billion in royalties was squandered with no benefit at all for the population.
1,"Chavez' short but tumultuous time in power, which he achieved by electoral means following a failed mutiny, arouses fears concerning the future of Latin America's oldest democracy."
1,"That situation has changed considerably since Chavez issued, by decree, a package of 49 laws of a nationalizing character."
1,"Shortly after that, on the occasion of the attack on the twin towers in New York, Chavez said that the US reaction to Taliban terrorism was also a terrorist act, thereby straining his relations with Washington."
1,"It has long been known that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has influence on Chavez, who has asked him for advice more than once."
1,"Dramatic things may be happening in the Venezuelan situation, and it is more than time for Brazilian diplomats to take notice of South American necessities."
1,"All of that stands in brutal contrast to the 1970\'s, the decade of the petroleum boom, when Andres Perez was the ""socialist Little Father."""
1,The worst recession in recent decades has been alleviated only by the recent increase in petroleum prices.

1,"Cde Mugabe said the Government would do everything necessary to ensure the holding of a free and fair election, as it had done during all the previous elections conducted in the country since the attainment of independence in 1980."
1,"He cited as an example the case of British deputy Prime Minister, Mr Prescott, who punched a protester who had hit him with an egg in the run up to the general elections in Britain last year."
1,"On the other hand, the union was quick to enter into alliances with countries such as Uganda and Rwanda, which had no tradition of democratic polls."
1,Cde Mugabe expressed satisfaction with the Government's preparations for the election so far.
1,"The Government has accused Britain of being a player in Zimbabwe's internal politics, saying it would therefore not be an impartial observer."
1,Cde Mugabe said the poll would be held in the same way the Government has held other elections since 1980 despite statements by some Western governments that it will not be free and fair.
1,The EU was demonising Zimbabwe despite the fact that the country had a tradition of regular and democratic elections.
1,"Cde Mugabe said recalling the supreme sacrifice paid by Zimbabweans in their struggle for self-determination and the pride they take in exercising their sovereign right to elect a President of their choice, the Government would do everything necessary to ensure that they exercise their democratic right without interference from any quarter whatsoever, whether internal or external."

1,Presidential Reporter - PRESIDENT Mugabe yesterday invited foreign observers from various international organisations and some individual countries to come and observe the forthcoming Presidential election but will not allow observers from Britain.

1,"The President also appealed to all political parties, churches, war veterans, farmers' unions, trade unions, business associations, media houses, women and youth organisations and civic society to come together and exchange views on ending political violence."
1,"The election, he said, will once again underline Zimbabwe's established democratic tradition of holding regular parliamentary and presidential elections since the attainment of independence as provided for by its Constitution."
1,Sadc and Nigeria will be invited to send their observers immediately.
1,We will proceed with our election in the same way as we have proceeded.

0,The bags were discovered during a personal search in the inspection room and were hidden in the shoe soles.
0,"Axis is a term that was created by Mussolini signifying the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan."
1,It would be a choice that confirms the extremist inclinations of some members of the US Administration.
1,Its name was only mentioned in the axis of evil to remove suspicion around the United States' hostility to Islam.
1,"On the other hand, written speeches are more indicative of the policy drafted by the decision-making circles for a final decision by the President."
0,There is controversy about which type is more credible.
1,"If the United States wages a war against Iraq then this would not be out of necessity, like the war against terrorism."
1,The first is improvised and not devoid of slips of the tongue.
1,"This leaves Iraq, which the Washington circles want to antagonize and to go to war with."
1,"The second is carefully written and studied from every aspect, and represents the official policy of the country."
1,"Besides, politicians refer to good and evil only for purposes of intimidation and exaggeration."
1,"If it was viable to describe terrorist organizations as evil, then it is not viable to do the same for countries."
0,"The State of the Union Address, given by the President in a joint meeting of the House of Representatives and Senate every year, is a pre-prepared speech."
1,"In fact, Iraq and Iran were involved in the longest destructive war during the second half of the 20th century."
1,It is very unlikely that the United States would be involved in a war with it.
1,"As for North Korea, it is a country living in isolation and is keeping its good and evil from everyone else."
1,The US President is giving two kinds of speeches.
1,"The new axis, however, represents small developing countries that are not linked by any alliance or cooperation."
1,"The new axis of evil, which Bush has come up with, by combining the words of Mussolini and Reagan, was not a successful choice."
1,"As for evil, it is a term used by former President Reagan to describe the Soviet Union, although its evil was self-destructive, causing the country to collapse from within."
1,"Every phrase in it was carefully studied, particularly the phrase that referred to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as an axis of evil."
1,"Perhaps improvisation is a better indication of the inclinations and personal convictions of the President, because by improvising he is expressing what runs through his mind since the tongue is an extension of the heart."
0,"During World War II, the axis countries were very strong and bound by an alliance."
1,"As for Iran, the United States is eager to open a dialogue with it, especially since the reform school in Iran is progressing at the expense of the traditional, conservative school."
1,"With regard to the economic recovery on the other hand, the President announced his full support for the prime minister's structural reform and measures to fight deflation."
1,"Regarding the ""axis of evil,"" the prime minister explained his resolve to buckle down on the issue, while continuously cooperating with the United States."
1,The biggest concern in that case would be Japan's military support system.
0,"President Bush took up the matter of the ""axis of evil"" and Japan\'s economic recovery as topics at the beginning of the summit talks."
1,"At the same time, Japan also plans to ""work on Iran and North Korea through Japan\'s own diplomatic channels for settlement of the issue,"" (according to a government source)."
1,He explained a view aimed at solving the issue through diplomatic and other means for the time being.
1,"In the case of military actions against Iran on the other hand, it also seems that ""judging from the lessons we learned from the Gulf War, Japan, which relies on the crude oil from the Middle East, cannot refuse offering cooperation,"" (said a Defense Agency source)."
0,"It turned out that the prime minister will shoulder the burden of firmly carrying out the reforms, and realizing early economic recovery as international pledges."
1,He then clarified a posture wherein Japan would cooperate with the United States as much as possible.
1,"""The US strategy is beginning to work,"" (said a Foreign Ministry source)."
1,"As this indicates, discussion on the ""axis of evil"" was the main purpose of the President\'s visit to Japan."
1,"To tighten the noose around the ""axis of evil,"" the Japanese Government will seek understanding and cooperation from European countries that are critical of the President."
1,This will lead us to the issue of exercising the right of collective self-defense.
1,It seems that the government will enact the law for emergencies in an area surrounding Japan if the United States takes military actions against North Korea.
1,"Saying that ""all options are on the table"" to deal with the ""axis of evil,"" the President also stated at the summit talks that he would ""seek a peaceful settlement."""
0,But improvement has not yet been made to the emergency legislation system.
1,"At a joint news conference held after the summit talks, the prime minister announced his understanding and approval of the President\'s statement designed to deal with the ""axis of evil."""
1,"Also, there is a possibility of armed attacks on Japan."
1,"Issues to deal with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea -- which the US President branded as the ""axis of evil"" in his statement to fight against international terrorism -- and activation of the Japanese economy were the major topics of discussion at the Japan-US summit talks held on 18 February between Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush."
1,"It seems likely that in addition to its diplomatic efforts, the Japanese Government will be forced to take concrete actions, including improvement of its legal system, in case the United States takes military actions."
1,"The prime minister announced his cooperation with the United States because he fully understands that ""the United States needs Japan\'s cooperation,"" (said a senior Foreign Ministry official)."
1,"While cooperating with the United States, Japan will take the initiative in tackling the issue for eradication of terrorism."""
1,"Since President Bush envisions using all options, however, we cannot deny the possibility that the United States may take military actions."
1,"Moreover, Iraq is expected to fight back if it is attacked."
1,"""I believe the comments on the \'axis of evil\' reflect the firm resolve of President Bush and the United States against terrorism."
1,There is a strong view among officials of the government and the ruling parties that application of the law for special measures to deal with terrorism would be difficult because this law is limited to dealing with the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States only.
1,"Therefore, the Japanese Government will be forced to introduce diverse legislation for the purpose of giving cooperation for US military actions."
1,"Ever since the President announced the ""axis of evil"" statement in January, Iran, Iraq, North Korea have been trying hard, out of the fear of possible confrontation with the United States, to deny their involvement in terrorism or proliferation of mass destruction weapons."
1,"But the reality is that ""there are many problems, including role sharing in joint actions with the US military, that we need to settle if we want to apply the law,"" (said a Defense Agency source)."

1,"Notwithstanding, the United States is insisting that so-and-so is part of the ""axis of evil."""
1,The position of Middle East nations for a fair settlement on problems of their region also won the support of international communities.
1,"Western nations and US allies, for the first time ever, took such a concerted stance critical of Washington."

1,"In contrast, injustice cannot escape denunciation and rejection."
1,"In February, many countries around the world and international public opinion came forth supporting our country."
1,The general situation in the new century is making turns in favor of the independent developments of progressive nations including our country.
1,"In a rally held in Syria, activists emphasized that ""we will continue to strengthen our solidarity with the Korean people and always stand with them in the same trench steadfastly."""
1,"It was because Japan, taking the stand supporting Bush\'s ""axis of evil"" rhetoric, openly embarked on the path of maneuvering for overseas aggression."
1,This fact proved that the world stands on the side of justice.
1,It precisely is an empire of evil.
1,"A spokesman of the EU Commission, at a press conference, expressed concerns over the Bush gaffe labeling [North] Korea, Iran, and Iraq as the ""axis of evil"" and said that ""the EU\'s high representatives do not agree to such policy."""
1,"To prove it, the arguments gained ground in many countries that, for a fair settlement on the Middle East issues, Israel must discontinue its attacks against Palestine and suppression of Palestinians and the United States must not use double standards."
1,"The denunciation and rejection of injustice and the support and encouragement to justice, evident in the February international developments, do reflect change in the 21st-century international relations in which imperialists are weakening and aspirations to independence are strengthening."
1,"This time, however, they spoke out against it and attacked without hesitation."
1,"Like this, it is inevitable for injustice to meet denunciation and rejection."
1,"Bush\'s ""axis of evil"" argument is an undisguised declaration of war and a rhetoric threatening aggression."
1,"Justice always finds support, however."
1,"In February, the media in many countries around the world and international public opinion came forward opposing Bush\'s ""axis of evil"" remark."
1,"US military and diplomatic officials also came forward justifying Bush\'s ""axis of evil"" remark."

1,"Bush, in a flurry at such moves, went the length of staging the farce of creating a permanent diplomatic agency to prevent the spread of anti-US sentiment."
1,Everyone opposes and rejects it.
1,"Meanwhile, in various countries around the world, demonstrations and rallies against the Bush remark and the United States were held almost daily."
1,"In the past, it was their attitude trying to read Washington's mind and doing nothing that would incur its displeasure."

0,"Palestine is not an independent state with an army that may soon, if unchecked, march into the streets of Tel Aviv or overrun Jerusalem."
1,It is a fact that Palestinians are becoming more militant and that the nature of their resistance to occupation is changing dramatically.
1,He would want to show the Israelis that they will not be safe unless his army escalates that aggression to a point where the Palestinians would beg for surrender.
1,"In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon and its troops reached Beirut in a one-sided war that was aimed at destroying the PLO and burying Palestinian claims to their land for good."
1,"The first popular uprising, the Intifada, of 1987 and then the second one, which erupted 18 months ago, were desperate means by conquered Palestinians to end the occupation."
1,"Throughout these wars and invasions, the West Bank and Gaza Strip and millions of Palestinian inhabitants succumbed under the mighty stranglehold of Israeli occupation."
1,"Sharon is managing and sustaining a pogrom that puts every Jew and every Israeli to shame, because the enemy for Sharon's soldiers is largely invisible."
1,"Throughout these years Israel kept on building new settlements or ""fattening"" existing ones and expropriating Palestinians lands."
1,Palestinian territories remain under occupation and the political process that was launched in the early 1990's to end it has floundered.
1,But it is not war by any military definition.
1,They are also legitimate options of national liberation.
1,Palestinian reprisals also hurt innocent Israelis because Sharon and his policies have made every Israeli an enemy and a target.
1,"In the past 18 months more than 1200 Palestinians have been killed, mostly civilians, and mostly in their homes, camps, offices, schools, and factories -- not on the battlefield."
1,Those who say the Palestinians had never tried non-violent means of resistance forget that they had endured more than 20 years of occupation pleading their cases before their occupiers and world public opinion.
1,It is chaos bordering on a binge of wanton killing that is achieving nothing in political or military terms for either side.
1,But the truth of the matter is that Israel and the Palestinians are not at war.
1,"And as long as this pretence of a vicious war against Israel holds, Sharon can keep his waning grip on power for more time."
1,Their shells and bullets are gunning down innocent people on daily basis.
1,And by applying the pressure cooker effect he will only reap sporadic but painful retaliatory responses from young and hateful Palestinians who seek liberation in death rather than staying alive under occupation.
1,"But judging from how the cycle of violence accelerated in the past few weeks, the war that the former general wants to ignite is not going to come."
1,"Many thousands were maimed and injured, hundreds of homes demolished and thousands of hectares of farmland destroyed."
1,There is no war other than the blind and murderous rage of a defeated colonial power.
1,"Against the backdrop of a brutal occupation, the only war that Sharon is waging is against the only possible salvation, which is an eventual peaceful coexistence between two peoples who will have to learn to accept and to share the same land."
1,"An estimated 130,472 Palestinians had been injured, 481 expelled, 22,088 held without trial, 2533 houses demolished or sealed and, equally important for the eventual division of the land, 184,257 Palestinian trees uprooted."""
1,"Israel already occupies the West Bank and Gaza Strip and has done so since June 1967, when Israel and neighboring Arab states fought a six-day war."
1,Sharon would want to describe his aggression as a war.
1,"Instead, he has invented a reality that is much worse than war."
0,"In October 1973 Israel fought a real war on two fronts, one against Syria and the other against Egypt."
1,Ariel Sharon would want the Israeli public to believe that it is a war out there and that the Palestinians are bent on destroying the state of Israel.
1,"If these statistics amount to anything, they point to the continuing waste of human life and property that millions of Palestinians under occupation endure on a daily basis."
1,Israelis are not expected to abandon their prime minister in the middle of a war!
0,"The Palestine Human Rights Information Group reported at the end of 1993 that ""since the start of the first Intifada, Israeli troops and settlers had killed 1283 Palestinians."
1,What Sharon has succeeded in doing is to radicalize the Palestinians even further.
1,"In 1987, they revolted, resorting to stones, demonstrations and strikes, and the Israelis responded swiftly by breaking their limbs and shooting unarmed civilian demonstrators in cold blood."

1,"""Certain excesses at EU meetings and, above all, at \'summits,\' the so-called \'high masses,\' sometimes call for a reaction."
1,"Neyts rejects all forms of violence, but understands the protests."
1,I think that the development debate does not focus enough on political development and political stability.
1,"That is not what it is all about."""
1,"To do this, regulations and a structure like the WTO are needed."
1,"""Trade alone will not save the world,"" Neyts said, ""but in as far as it refers to the free exchange of products and movement of persons, it constitutes an important factor for economic development."""
1,But this can only change if we negotiate.

1,"That leaves the most economically realistic solution, the one backed by the technical experts: Floating the currency, but it is also the most risky."
1,"More than ever in fact, as the financial crisis that is shaking Buenos Aires has a useful message for us: The choice of a currency can never be reduced to a simple act of political will."
1,Appeals were already made to the creditors during the first phase of the debt rescheduling involving the $55 billion held by Argentine funds and that was completed at the end of November.
1,"But it would also be a very painful way of restoring credibility, ""like when one loses one\'s virginity and the only solution is to enter a convent,"" as one monetary expert put it."
0,"Other countries live on a currency board system, most notably Hong Kong."

1,"But neither dollarization nor the currency board provides a guarantee of low interest rates, as there will always be an ""Argentine risk."""

1,"And they will come under pressure again: The IMF's recent refusal to approve a $1.3 billion loan is designed specifically to help Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo put pressure on private investors, as the latter have clearly understood even if not always the observers."
1,"The real gauge of this confidence was the size of the national debt, that grew and grew."
1,"One must understand all the implications, often unfortunately invisible."
1,"Michael Mussa, chief economist with the IMF until last April, recognizes this: ""If we had paid more attention to the growing budgetary deficit and national debt between 1996 and 1998, Argentina would have been in a much better position to absorb the impact of the devaluation of the Brazilian real."""
1,Plus there is the problem of external competitiveness that remains unsolved.
1,The Argentines thought they had discovered the philosopher's stone in 1991.
1,"The commitment to liberalism, the second strand of the Menem program, lived up to its promises."
0,Argentine pension funds have enjoyed interest rates as high as 35 percent over recent months: No less than 45 percent of the national debt estimated at between $130 and $150 billion is held by the Argentines themselves.
1,Are the Argentines now in a position to forge a new social contract?
1,"The fall came in 1998, when Brazil, made vulnerable by the Asian crisis, abandoned its fixed parity against the dollar."
0,Over recent weeks street demonstrations culminating in the general strike of 13 December have been the most visible aspect of a civil war between creditors and debtors.
1,"This is why dollarization has generated such support among politicians: From former President Carlos Menem, today leader of the most influential Peronist faction, to new Finance Secretary Miguel Kiguel, a former banker, charged along with Domingo Cavallo with restoring order to public finances."
1,"The linking to the dollar, as a guarantee of stability, was meant to rid them of the hyperinflation running at 2000 percent a year they had experienced during the 1970s and 80s."
1,"The risk premium has always been considerable, rates never falling below 10 percent."

1,"Unless the peso is devalued before it disappears, that is technically possible but more delicate when it comes to credibility."
1,"But this Chinese territory has an extremely open economy, to the point where its exports exceed its GDP, thereby facilitating the influx of foreign currency."
1,"First paradox: The Argentine economy is not very open, not even to its neighbors in Latin America."
1,Hence the official parity between the peso and the dollar until 1 December 2001 when it became necessary to introduce exchange controls with a devastating effect.
0,"The result is a trade balance, in marked contrast to a balance of payments deficit burdened by servicing its debt."
1,The final switch to the dollar would stabilize relations between creditors and debtors.
1,"It is not enough to proclaim, even in the Constitution, that one peso is worth one dollar, for that to be really the case."
1,At the same time private debtors who became indebted in a strong currency would find themselves ruined by a peso devaluation.
1,Second paradox: The self-proclaimed parity between the peso and the dollar never enabled the government and even less private borrowers to obtain credit terms to match those enjoyed by the Americans.
1,Looking back one can see a general lack of vigilance.
1,"Economists and market players then noticed that Argentina had been ""over-financed."""
0,The social contract implemented by Carlos Menem at the start of his 10-year presidency (1989-99) was simple in principle and based on two pillars: Monetary discipline and liberalism.
1,So is it really the moment to take a look at Argentina?
1,"The Europeans are enthusiastically holding in their hands ""the euro, our currency"" that for so long had been no more than a much-wielded slogan."
1,This places an unbearable burden on the government in servicing the debt and a revenue to match for the creditors.
1,"""Credibility evaporated,"" to quote the expression of one expert who stresses the paradoxes of a system whose bases seemed sound."
1,The tale today is all the more bitter as it began with such euphoria.
0,"Its exports amount to just 8 percent of its GDP, as do its imports."

1,The Proton family of rockets the Khrunichev center produces is one of the most popular commodities on the international market for the launch of heavy carriers.

1,Space remains a Russian national priority.
1,"One can imagine how Rumsfield, who is ordinarily so sure of himself and of his jokes, might have gone off his rocker once and, for an hour, could have ranted and raved against the ""hyperbole,"" the exaggeration that, according to him, marked the reactions generated by this photograph, and reminded the world about the degree to which the US attitude was ""humane, legal, and proper."""
1,"And that the Europeans, in particular, are no longer quite ready to follow the Americans in their way of thinking."
1,"That, however, is the problem."
1,"Until now, this right-this right right, if one prefers-has more or less been accepted by Washington's partners."
1,"Washington officials refuse this school of thought (which would lead them to refrain from interrogating the prisoners, indeed to release them after the end of the hostilities) but seem to be aware of the fact that here they are not on very solid legal ground."
1,"""Bush is quite close to pulling off the impossible: losing the sympathy of the civilized world for the United States,"" an astonished The Daily Mirror wrote."
1,"Even certain US newspapers, led by The New York Times , have hinted at some doubts about the Pentagon's attitude."
1,The distress generated by one photograph published inadvertently or through excess self-confidence might only mean that this consensus is in the process of eroding.
1,"Throughout this Afghan campaign, there have been some other slightly troubling images."
1,"But, however, they were under medical supervision, their heads shaved, and enjoying hygienic and food conditions that were very superior to what they could have known in Afghanistan."
1,The End and the Means
1,"That, in theory, would seem to make him a prisoner of war par excellence if Washington were now not confusing the Taliban regime (which the US has destroyed, but without declaring war on it) with Al-Qa'ida's terrorist network."
1,"At the end of a brilliantly waged and very carefully framed war, punctuated by briefings that had brought Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary, a veritable media triumph, there was this one image too many."
1,"Since 11 September, the US has behaved as if it had a sort of natural right to create law."
1,"There is now, in a sort of provisional epilogue, this quasi-Orwellian image of totally dominated men deprived of the use of their senses."
1,"But perhaps there is something else, deeper, more diffuse."
1,"One must not confuse ""justice and vengeance,"" lest one lose one\'s ""moral advantage,"" European commissioner Chris Patten explained."
1,"Some real, concrete, like those of these fighters in rags, haggard, who were the survivors of weeks of bombing."
1,"In the commentaries of newspapers that were the most well disposed toward the United States ( The Daily Telegraph and The Times of London), in the very remarks by certain officials from the ""coalition,"" the reactions, quite particularly in Great Britain, the US\'s top ally in Afghanistan, have ranged from incomprehension to indignation, from slight confusion to high distress."
1,"There have also been, based more on intuition than on images, doubts about the match-up between the end and the means, and the admiration, mixed with fear, that an implacable force generates, that of US missiles and airplanes in action."
1,"This ""legal"" aspect of the debate is now quite well known: the prisoners taken on the ground are considered to be ""illegal combatants"" by the Americans and not prisoners of war."
1,"Such could be the lesson drawn by the Pentagon and the White House from the hue and cry that has been provoked in the world by the release of the now famous photographs of blinded, gagged, chained, and kneeling prisoners in their enclosure at the Guantanamo camp."
1,"Only US officials know (or think they know) who these men are whose identities have not been made public: according to certain US media, the most ""important"" of the Guantanamo prisoners is reportedly the Taliban army\'s chief of general staff."
0,It was a photograph taken by a US soldier and officially disseminated by the United States Navy on a Defense Department Internet site.
1,"Because they had been the victims of terrorist attacks and, more deeply, because Americans are ""good,"" even if, as President Bush had explained, the world did not always realize ""how good they were."""
1,"Those of members of the US special forces, equipped with all their panopoly of soldiers of the future and, this arresting contrast, those of their ""auxiliaries"" from the Northern Alliance, barefoot, wearing sandals and in the snow, at the entrance to caves they were responsible for cleaning up."
1,"Big Brother, even democratically elected and at war against evil, is perforce a bit scary."
1,"All this for a single photograph, something that, after all, was quite neat and tidy, in which men are seen dressed in gleaming suits and modern, civilized instruments of coercion (blinding eyeglasses, masks incapacitating the mouth and nose, ear-splitting ear phones)?"
1,"So an edifying photograph, or viewed as such, but one which, the explanation is, in fact is deceiving: the prisoners were reportedly photographed shortly after their arrival, that is, if one understands this correctly, they were shackled and blinded as they had been during the 27-hour trip from Afghanistan to Cuba."
1,"Just as is the fact that ""the"" US Al-Qa\'ida fighter, John Walker Lindh, will not be shut up in one of the four square meter cages at Guantanamo but sent to a US prison and tried by a normal court."
1,"Other more virtual ones (because in this case the communication was better monitored) of Marines protected with surgical masks and gloves transporting prisoners chained to stretchers to planes, as journalists from the print media were able to see them using binoculars."
1,You can never be too sure about what you are communicating.
1,"So Rumsfield stated that the prisoners\' treatment was ""reasonably consistent"" with the Geneva Conventions, which was a way of saying, in this particular case, that the US was the only judge of what was ""reasonable."""
1,"The solidity of this argument, though, has increasingly been demolished, by, among others, the Red Cross, which thinks that, until proof (legally established) of the contrary, the prisoners should be considered prisoners of war."
1,"""They are not POWs, they are unlawful combatants,"" Rumsfeld told reporters at the US Naval Base."
1,Rumsfeld has asserted repeatedly that the detainees are getting good treatment and refused to grant them war prisoner status.
0,Rumsfeld's itinerary for his trip to Camp X-ray at Guantanamo included a tour of the facilities and meetings with military leaders and US troops who are keeping watch over the 158 Afghan war detainees there.

1,"The addition to passports is a move that the leader of the Taiwanese authorities has long premeditated, carefully planned, and gradually implemented."
1,This is really an unwise idea.
1,The United States has made a commitment that it will not change its Taiwan policy.
1,"Its harm is not limited to the incident itself, but lies in the fact that it is an important step for the Taiwanese authorities to promote its ""gradual Taiwan independence."""
1,"In November, he manufactured the so-called ""three acknowledgements and four suggestions"" and then claimed that the two sides of the strait ""are not subordinated to each other, and do not represent each other."""
0,This caused strong opposition from all the various aspects.
1,It is worth special attention that the mainland's stance on the Taiwan issue is very clear and has never changed.
1,"In fact, the economic difficulties in the island, the political deadlock, and the public's confidence crisis should be the agenda for the Taiwanese authorities' top concern."
0,"Recently, the Taiwan ""Press Bureau"" stopped using the symbol with the map of China."
1,"In his 2001 New Year\'s speech, he proposed the ambiguous ""conformity theory,"" which takes the tone of unification but promotes independence in nature."
0,"In May 2000, ""Taiwan independence"" activist Yao Jiawen claimed in Tokyo, Japan that the Taiwanese authorities instructed its ""Foreign Ministry"" to change the English translation of the ""People\'s Republic of China"" on passports to ""Taiwan,"" and name all overseas agencies ""Taiwanese"" agencies."

1,"All these activities to ""change the name of Taiwan,"" along with the Taiwanese authorities\' comprehensive policies of ""separating from China"" in ideology, culture, history, education and the media, are all attempts to separate Taiwan from China, and change its status as a part of China."

1,What exactly then is a manned spaceship?
0,"To facilitate recovery and rescue in future manned spaceflight, the recovery site will be located in sparsely populated grassland or the wilderness."
0,China has launched three unmanned spacecraft consecutively and exhibited to the world the capsules recovered.
0,"In the altitude of about several thousands of meters, the return capsule will eject the parachutes to further reduce the speed."
1,"According to the experience of the United States and Russia, one of the greatest problems of manned spaceship is inadequate power supply."

1,Yet it refuses to treat those it has captured in the course of this war as prisoners of war.
0,"Under the Geneva Convention, prisoners of war must be treated humanely."
0,"The convention exempts only those, such as spies and saboteurs, who do not clearly identify themselves as belligerents."
1,"More likely though, the U.S. is using the broadest of brooms to sweep up detainees for Cuba."
1,"Instead, it refers to them as ""unlawful combatants"" not entitled to the protection of the 1949 Geneva Convention, which the U.S. signed and which sets out rules for treating enemy soldiers."
1,"(The blindfolding, deliberate disorientation, discomfort and constant light are staples of police states all over the world."

0,"Those detainees, brought shackled, shaved and blindfolded to Cuba, are kept in chain link pens under the constant glare, night and day, of halogen lamps."
1,But the world is a perverse place.
1,"Washington is brazen about its flouting of international law, secure in the knowledge that neither its citizens not its allies will complain."
1,Is the war on terrorism a war or is it not?
1,"First, it assumes that those selected for Guantanamo are connected to the Sept. 11 attacks."
1,It is considered legitimate self-defence for the U.S. and its allies to invade Afghanistan.
1,"It shackles them, houses them in unprotected chain link compounds (in Cuba, of all places) and threatens ""intense interrogation."""
1,The U.S. government says that the terrorist attack on New York City was an act of war.
1,"So if Sept. 11 was an act of war, why are those captured in the aftermath not treated as prisoners of war?"
1,"Many (including me) saw the attacks on New York as a monstrous criminal outrage, rather than an act of war."
1,"But clearly it was meant to apply to the Taliban and Al Qa'ida fighters captured after vicious battles in Afghanistan, fighters who made no secret of who they were, what they were supporting and who they thought their enemies were."
1,"Their captors are forbidden from inflicting ""outrages upon personal dignity"" or ""inhumane and degrading treatment."""
1,Perhaps it is perverse to have rules for warfare.
1,"And so, since the late 19th century, most nations that call themselves civilized have adhered to such rules."
0,But President George W. Bush determined otherwise.
1,"Let us hope that, in this instance, the terrible equation does not hold."
1,Anyone waging war on the U.S. would have targeted Manhattan in the hope of damaging the American economy - as the World Trade Center attack did.
1,"But it sets a dangerous precedent for all soldiers who face capture in the so-called war on terrorism, including Canada's."
0,"Both New York City and the Pentagon are legitimate wartime targets - the former economic, the latter military."
1,Why is it not considered equally legitimate for the Afghans and their allies to resist this invasion?
1,The assumption is that what we do to them will be done to us.
1,"The idea is to break down the inmate, weaken him from lack of sleep and thereby make him more pliable when the interrogators begin their serious work)."
1,"Maybe some are (although the world would have a better idea if the U.S., in line with the Geneva Convention, specified just who it was holding)."
1,"But if Sept. 11 was an act of war, then it becomes, in a weird way, less monstrous."
1,These are not abstract questions.
1,"But then, if they were dealt with properly, the U.S. would have less leeway."
0,"Under the convention, they must ""be quartered under conditions as favourable as those for forces of the detaining power who are billeted in the same area."""
0,"By treating Sept. 11 as war, Bush was able to call into play the right of self-defence mandated by the United Nations."
0,"Prisoners of war are not required to give their captors information beyond name, rank and serial number."
1,"The more fundamental problem, though, has to do with logic."
1,Countries sign on to the Geneva Convention not to be altruistic but to ensure that their own soldiers will be well treated if captured.
0,"The 1949 Geneva Convention specifies that any belligerents captured in the course of war - be they regular soldiers, militia members or volunteers ""operating in or outside their territory even if this territory is occupied"" - must be accorded prisoner of war status."
1,This may be convenient for Washington.
1,"Indeed, many Americans (and some Canadians) probably think anyone connected to the Sept. 11 terror attacks deserves whatever he gets."

1,Why has the United States been picking on Chavez and Bustani all this time?
1,Even some major media in the United States have thoroughly unmasked the attitude taken by the US Government towards the cope farce in Venezuela.
1,"Both the White House and the US State Department expressed ""satisfaction"" over the stepping-down of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela\'s constitutional president, and no one ""wept over him."""
1,"Although the White House and the Pentagon have denied supporting the oppositions in Venezuela to stage this coup, the world will not be easily fooled as it can judge from the several official statements made by the US Government both before and after the coup."
1,This reminds one of a witty remark made by US President Franklin Roosevelt in the old days.
1,"This special meeting was initiated by the United States, with only one single goal to fulfill, that is, instigating OPCW member states to vote out Bustani."
1,"When questioned by a reporter ""why the United States has supported a certain cold-blooded dictator in Latin America,"" Roosevelt gave a vivid reply: This dictator ""may be a son of bitch, yet he is our (the United States) son of bitch."""
1,"It will not be a ""coup"" so long as the United States thinks it is not!"
1,"As for the recent event in which Jose Bustani, director-general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], was voted out of office at the organization\'s special plenary session, there clearly existed an ""American background."""
1,"To the United States, what Bustani wanted to do was even more intolerable, as it would disrupt the US plan of launching a military strike against Iraq."
1,"After Chavez took office as Venezuelan president, he has pursued an independent foreign policy, and has been out of step with the United States in many areas."
1,"It has been reported that the United States had earlier held a secret meeting with a number of countries, promising to pay for their long due OPCW membership fees if they could vote according to the wish of the United States."
1,"When Chavez resumed power, a senior US official in charge of national security commented that ""Chavez should reflect on himself,"" as ""his ship has been sailing towards a wrong direction for far too long."""
1,"At the time when the abortive coup had just taken place, the United States ""did not show the slightest sympathy,"" still less ""the least regret,"" for the breaking-off of Venezuela\'s democratic system."
1,"On the issue whether the coup farce staged in Venezuela not long ago had an ""American background,"" the world media have made many reports, comments, and conjectures."
1,"They have pointed out: When will a ""coup"" not be called a ""coup""?"
1,"According to New York Times, the United States is inclined to put friendly faces in the Presidential Palace of Latin American nations, no matter whether or not these faces are wearing army uniforms."
1,"Besides, they also claimed that Chavez ""had only himself to blame"" for the coup."
1,"In simpler terms, the interests of the United States are always above everything else, not only above the sovereignty of other nations, but also above the so-called values of ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" that the US always likes to dwell on."
1,All these are eyesores to the United States.
1,"As for Bustani, he hoped that Baghdad could become a member of the OPCW so that the United Nations could conduct arms inspections in the country."
1,"During his visits to some OPEC member states in 2000, he also paid a visit to Baghdad; meanwhile, he has all along maintained a close relationship with Cuba."

1,"The parties argued that there were ""no emergency circumstances"" warranting the enactment of a temporary law on elections."
0,"The Constitution allows the executive branch to issue temporary laws in the absence of Parliament, provided there is a ""state of emergency."""
1,"The law, which clarified voting procedures but maintained the controversial one-person, one-vote formula, was endorsed by the government in July, just over a month after the dissolution of the Lower House. "

0,"During the Kim-Bush summit, the Kim administration will convey its plans to the United States."
1,"North Korea has likened Bush\'s ""axis of evil"" remark to a declaration of war."
1,Bush's Asian trip could serve as a turning point for his government's North Korea policy.
1,"In a related development, the Seoul government reportedly decided to resume talks with North Korea to deliver the concerns of the United States and the international community about its weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons."
1,"The two leaders will also address North Korea's conventional military posture, while reconfirming their traditional cooperation in dealing with North Korea."

0,"Since 1997, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has frequently interacted with other world leaders to overcome obstacles and open up paths to negotiation."
1,"A formidable deadlock occurred, however, at the meeting in The Hague at the end of 2000, and it seriously threatened the protocol's future."
0,Only three important points were left over for Marrakesh.
1,"Also contributing was the interested and well-organized participation of nongovernmental sectors in Brazil, including the private sector."
1,The problem is neither simple nor minor.
0,"The first had to do with the legal status of the protocol, a question that had already been the object of a political accord in Bonn."
1,President Fernando Henrique Cardoso spoke with his colleagues at bilateral meetings and emphasized to the French National Assembly and the UN General Assembly the need for multilateral diplomacy in dealing with a problem involving the basic principle of shared but differentiated responsibility on the part of all countries.
0,But the cost is high and requires a change in the way energy is generated as well as in means of transportation and agricultural practices.
1,Particularly affected would be the world's poorer regions.
1,"That will be proof, on its 10th anniversary, of the success of the Rio Conference, where this whole important effort began."
1,"The controversy over that subject contributed to the deadlock at the conference in The Hague last year, since the pressure to include such activities was very strong in view of their zero cost."
1,"The idea for the CDM originated, at least in part, in a concept successfully advocated by Brazil during the Kyoto negotiations in 1997."
1,It is predicted that a sufficient number of countries will do the same so that the protocol will take effect before the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002.
0,Minister of Science and Technology Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg headed Brazil's delegation to the Seventh Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Marrakesh.
0,An example of this is the simple presence or aging of forests.
1,The third big challenge concerns land use: a change in the way land and forests are used so as to prevent the inclusion of activities that do not lead to a real reduction in emissions.
0,President Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced at the United Nations that he would submit the protocol to the National Congress for ratification.
1,"Also contributing was the excellent technical preparation and mature action of the Brazilian delegation, which consisted of experienced negotiators."
0,"The proper regulation as finally achieved represents a balance between restrictions on free use of the mechanisms so as to ensure that the reductions are real--that is, physical and not just bookkeeping exercises--and, at the same time, to keep some flexibility in the controls so as not to burden the compensation transactions excessively."
1,That will facilitate their possible convergence later with the international system.
1,Brazil contributed greatly to the success in Marrakesh.
1,"At a new meeting in Bonn in July of this year, thanks to the efforts of many delegations, including that from Brazil, which played a leading role, it was possible to isolate five areas for negotiation."
1,"It had already been decided in Kyoto to set goals for reducing emissions, initially for the industrialized countries so that distribution of the resulting burden would be accepted as fair by all."
1,"Even the United States, which declared for its own reasons that it did not intend to ratify it, has been giving indications that it will adopt domestic measures using concepts capable of being harmonized with those set forth in the protocol."
1,"Their participation was a demonstration, not always seen in other countries, that government and the private sector are working together in the country's interests."
1,But only now has it been possible to express the matter in satisfactory terms.
1,"The one that interests us in particular is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which applies to countries such as Brazil."
1,It was possible to ensure the environmental integrity of the protocol and to maintain control over the mechanism.
0,The Kyoto Protocol expresses the world's political will and is becoming the dominant norm in that field from the standpoint of international public law.
1,The countries and even the companies involved won the assurance in Marrakesh that actual implementation of the protocol will be carried out in a legally binding manner.
1,Now the international community is being forced to face reality: there is only one way to prevent those effects or reduce them to the minimum: emissions must be limited.
1,Its objective was to complete the regulations governing the Kyoto Protocol and thereby create political and technical conditions for the latter's ratification by the international community.
1,"If nothing were done, the temperature of the atmosphere would rise by a few degrees this century with unmistakable and potentially disastrous effects."
1,"Brazil was elected by consensus, and with the support of Latin America, to the CDM Executive Committee."
0,"Also contributing were our talks with ministers of various key countries in the negotiations, ranging from China, India, Nigeria, Iran, and Argentina among the developing nations to Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany among the industrialized countries."
1,"After four years of arduous negotiations, the Marrakesh conference ended successfully at 0600 hours last Saturday."
1,"Ever since a ministerial meeting in 1999, I have advocated that that mechanism begin its activities as quickly as possible, a step that was finally accepted in Marrakesh."
0,Brazil's objectives were fully achieved.
1,The understanding prevailed that climate change is global and presents a challenge to the world's leaders.
1,The latest available scientific report states flatly that the global warming already observed--about 0.5 degree Celsius--is due to human activity and results from the emission of carbon dioxide and other gases.
1,"With the protocol in effect, it will be possible to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the industrialized countries and, consequently, to combat the global warming of the atmosphere for the benefit and well-being of future generations all over the planet."
0,The CDM Executive Committee will actually begin operating as soon as the Kyoto Protocol takes effect.
1,The second big challenge was to regulate in detail the compensation mechanisms for reducing emissions.
1,"Seoul, Nov. 16 (Yonhap) -- The number of employees working on a temporary or daily basis have increased drastically as companies moved to slash labor costs after the financial crisis in 1997, the National Statistical Office (NSO) said Friday."
0,"NSO statistics showed that the number of workers employed on a temporary and daily basis rose by 888,000 to 6,962,000 in October compared with late 1997."

0,Over 90 percent of full-time workers receive retirement allowances and bonuses but the comparable numbers fell to 10 percent for temporary workers and 1 percent for those employed on a daily basis.
0,"""Demand for those working on a temporary or daily basis is risiing because companies are trying to save labor costs amid the continued economic slowdown,"" an NSO official said."

1,"Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan Sunday urged immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's residence and called for Arafat 's personal safety to be ensured."
1,"The Chinese government is deeply concerned about the sudden deterioration in the Middle East situation, Tang said."
0,Peres briefed Tang on the latest development of the conflict between the two sides.
1,"In response to Tang's enquiry, he expressed that Israel is willing to promise to the international community that Israel will not threaten Arafat's personal safety and will not destroy the Palestine National Authority."
1,Tang asked Israel to do so in order to serve the overall requirement of security and stability in the Middle East as well as Israel's own long-term interest.
0,Tang made the remarks in a phone conversation with Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
1,"Arafat, as leader of the Palestinian people and one of the initiators of peace talks between Israel and Palestine, has made great efforts to push forward the Middle East peace process, Tang said, stressing that disastrous consequences would happen to the Middle East region if unexpected incidents took place to Arafat's safety."
1,"Tang expressed his hope that Israel will implement Resolution 1402 of the United Nations Security Council unconditionally, withdraw its troops completely from Palestinian areas and solve the problems through peaceful means."
1,"Meanwhile, China opposes and condemns the recent violent activities in Israeli territory, and China expresses condolence, sympathy and solicitude to the family members of the victims, said Tang."
1,"The pressing matter of the moment is that Israel and Palestine should both exercise maximum restraint and adopt concrete measures to stop the conflict immediately and create conditions for resumption of the peace talks, Tang said."
1,"Tang said that the abrupt escalation of the conflict between Israel and Palestine has caused huge casualties and property losses, and Arafat's personal safety was severely endangered."
1,"The settlers, who number around 220,000 people, have taken the Israeli Government and consequently both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples hostage."
0,"The bomber was a member of Hamas, the radical Muslim organization."
1,The Palestinian Authority has effectively ceased to function.
1,He is now a prisoner in his own headquarters.
1,The day the Israeli tanks again leave Ramallah they will have sown the seed for new terrorist actions.
1,Military superiority cannot solve problems that are fundamentally of a political nature.
0,"Twenty-two people were killed, in addition to the suicide bomber, and 130 were injured."
1,The action that is currently taking place can at best only throw the terrorist groups off balance for a time.
1,No Arab leader was in any doubt that from Sharon's standpoint the resolution was not welcome.
0,"As a first step Israeli forces were sent into the main Palestinian town, Ramallah, where Arafat has his headquarters and from where the autonomous Palestinian areas are administered."
1,"Terrorism thrives in an atmosphere of hate, and the Israeli occupation and the use of military force are creating the fertile soil from which future terrorists will be recruited."
1,"Now he declared that Arafat was an ""enemy."""
1,Settlers Have Taken Palestine Hostage
1,"One-third Israelis, two-thirds Palestinians."
0,"Before he had announced his agreement, the Natanya massacre and the Israeli counteraction occurred."
1,"According to these sources, Sharon had accepted the cease-fire proposal, while Arafat hesitated."
1,But this is a conflict without winners.
1,"It was then that the Arab heads of state adopted the three noes: no to negotiations with Israel, no to recognition, no to peace."
0,"The escalation of the conflict has now cost over 1,000 people their lives in the space of the past 18 months."
1,A few hours after the end of the summit chance came to Sharon's rescue.
1,Quite the reverse: Anonymous U.S. sources say that Washington holds Arafat responsible for the fact that U.S. mediator Anthony Zinni's endeavors to arrange a cease-fire have now foundered.
1,The resolution forced him into a corner.
1,This time Washington is largely keeping silent.
1,A few days ago the parties in the Palestine conflict found themselves at a crossroads.
1,"On Thursday the Arab Summit in the Lebanese capital of Beirut ended with the adoption of a resolution whose content illustrated how far the Arab world has come since the summit that took place in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum in 1967, shortly after the Israeli victory in the Six Days War."
1,"It cannot solve the Israeli people's security problems, because the root of the terrorism is the Israeli occupation and the Israeli settlements on occupied territory."
1,It is likely that at present Sharon is entertaining similar thoughts and wants to create step by step a situation that will make it possible for him to rid himself of his enemy.
1,"Despite Arafat's promise to take action to neutralize the people on the list, he did not lift a finger."
1,"They decided to take steps to destroy the ""Palestinian terrorist structure, arrest its leaders, confiscate arms, and so on."""
1,"A few weeks previously Sharon had described Arafat as ""irrelevant."""
1,For the time being at least the United States has thus given Sharon a free hand.
0,"He demonstrated this he as defense minister during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which led to Arafat's being forced into exile in Tunis."
1,He was known to the Israeli intelligence service.
1,The summit's declaration was the best piece of news the Middle East has produced since the Oslo Accords between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat were signed on the lawn in front of the White House in Washington in 1993.
1,The resolution that was put forward by Saudi Arabia was a plea addressed to the Israeli people over the heads of Ariel Sharon's government.
1,Even the mention of one of the cardinal problems between Israel and the Palestinians - the future of the 3 million Arab refugees - was couched in terms softer than at any time in the past.
1,Circumstances have led to a situation where today the two parties in the conflict find themselves on the road that leads swiftly to the abyss.
1,"On Thursday the summit adopted a resolution that proposed the recognition of the Jewish state, normal relations, and an end to the conflict in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories that Israel has occupied for almost 35 years."
1,His problem is that he does not know what to do with it.
1,It has not sent the usual appeals to both sides.
0,His name figured on a list that Israel had shortly before handed over to the Palestinian security service.
0,Prior to the Natanya massacre Washington had imposed a number of limitations on Sharon.
1,"Israeli's antiterrorist operations must not bring the Palestinian Authority to collapse, Israeli forces must not reconquer the territories under the jurisdiction of the authority, and Arafat the man must not be molested."
0,On Thursday evening a Palestinian suicide bomber attacked a hotel in Natanya where a couple of hundred people had gathered for the traditional Passover meal.
0,That same night the Israeli security cabinet met.
1,"Sharon neither can nor will give up the occupied territories, and so he would be unmasked in the eyes of the whole world as the man standing in the way of peace in the Middle East."
1,Sharon is a master of escalation.
1,"The CEPD head, however, pointed out that it is still too early to comment to what extent the war would affect the local economy now that it is impossible for it to regain momentum by the end of this year."
1,"Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the United States, countries across the world have been closely monitoring subsequent developments and have taken measures to cope with possible situations, Wu said, noting that short-term pains will eventually pass and everyday life will get back to normal soon."
1,"Wu Hui-lin, a researcher at Change Hua Institution for Economic Research, however, predicted that business conditions in the world market would rebound very robustly in the short term, as the new hi-tech war will not last long and ""high-risks will bring about high investment returns."""
1,"Wu said optimistically that ""it is unnecessary to wait until next year for the recovery to take place"" on the ground that ""vast damage will produce opportunities for construction."""
1,"Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, investors across the world have been mired in uncertainties, Chen said, adding that should the war against Afghanistan not spread too much, the impact on the global economy will be limited."
1,"Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA) -- The United States military action in Afghanistan will help spur global investment sentiment by brushing aside many uncertain factors, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman Chen Po-chih said Monday."
0,"Tokyo, Oct. 8 Kyodo -- Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi will shorten his one-day visit to China on Monday by three hours due to the launch of U.S. and British retaliatory strikes in Afghanistan for the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the United States, government officials said."
1,"But, Koizumi has not changed his plan to visit the Marco Polo Bridge, the site of the 1937 clash that led to an eight-year war between Japan and China, and a nearby museum commemorating China's anti-Japanese movement, they said."
0,"Koizumi left for Beijing on Monday morning an hour after the originally scheduled time and will return to Tokyo two hours earlier than scheduled, the officials said."
1,"There is a real danger that the wounded but not yet eliminated network will play its ""trump card"" and commit further acts of terrorism."
1,"In the battle against the new forms of terrorism that reached a tragic culmination on 11 September, a limited form of military violence could also not be ruled out."
1,But we had no choice.
1,The whole operation against terrorism can have positive but also unintentionally negative effects on the international stage.
1,"The attacks on targets in Afghanistan that began yesterday [7 October], remain a risky enterprise."
1,"The coming days will reveal whether or not they were effective, were sufficiently precisely targeted and limited in scope."
1,Military violence constitutes -- in very exceptional circumstances -- a necessary evil in this very imperfect world.
1,The many and often confusing reports we have received over recent weeks on who may be responsible for the attacks already allows a clear pattern to be detected.
1,A strategy that worldwide must include both a degree of repression but most importantly constructive and positive measures.
1,"They took pains to build a broad coalition, and tried to make it clear to their own population and the international community that the enemy is not Islam but a very well defined and perverse interpretation of this religion."
1,"The economic impact of the 11 September attacks was already disastrous, with clear effects on the world economy, hitting the poorest countries by far the most."
1,"The fight against the new, transnational terrorism requires an exceptionally broad and committed strategy."
1,And they placed the stress on the battle of endurance that must follow.
1,But they cannot be any real talk of success until the broad strategy against terrorism begins to bear fruit.
1,To have sat back with arms folded would have made us all hostages.
1,"That is a clear condition for this first, unavoidable phase in the battle against terrorism to be humanly acceptable."
1,"That is a bitter pill to swallow in a thoroughly non-militaristic society such as ours, where the clash of weapons provokes healthy reactions of repulsion."
1,"Without armed violence the Nazi regime and similar forces that had the wind in their sails in Europe in the 1930s, would not have fallen."
1,But unfortunately there is little one can do about it.
1,"But to build this strategy, targeted attacks on the infrastructure available to Bin Ladin were necessary."
1,"The network with which Usama Bin Ladin and his followers tried to destroy the very foundations of the West has ramifications worldwide, vast amounts of money, and thanks to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan also a number of excellent training and attack bases."
1,The United States and its principal allies have acted with exceptional caution over recent weeks to the unbelievable provocation of the 11 September attacks.
1,"Whatever the case, we are entering a difficult period."
0,"The relief operation, which will involve some 900 troops, will begin on Saturday and last until 12 December, the Armed Forces' press service pointed out."
0,"On Sunday [25 November], the Belgian Army will begin relieving its troops that are stationed in Kosovo within the scope of the NATO-led peace force (KFOR [Kosovo Force])."
0,The replacement force will also include a Luxembourg contingent -- as has been the case since 1999 -- as well as a Romanian company including 84 troops.
0,The army announced this on Friday [23 November].
0,"But that did not stop Taliban commanders discussing the surrender of Kandahar, following calls from 70 Afghan tribal leaders for them to avert bloodshed."
1,"The campaign so far showed Alliance military success was the best way of getting food in, he said."
0,The city's top Taliban commander was among thousands of Afghan and foreign troops who gave themselves up after days of talks interspersed with fighting.
1,"""So there is quite a job to be done in creating a secure environment for humanitarian assistance."""
1,"His concerns echoed those voiced by leading charity Oxfam, which said instability across the country was hampering aid efforts."
1,"But the Prime Minister's official spokesman today said Tony Blair was pleased with the progress that had been made on the military, diplomatic and humanitarian fronts."
0,News of the Kandahar negotiations came after the Taliban control crumbled in their final northern stronghold of Kunduz following mass surrender.
0,His remarks came as the militia began talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar after Northern Alliance troops finally entered Kunduz.
1,"""The situation obviously remains fluid from hour to hour but it seems to be going in the right direction,"" the spokesman said."
0,"Hundreds of foreign fighters captured in the siege of the northern city were killed in a prison riot at a fortress outside Mazar-e-Sharif, the Northern Alliance said."
0,"We are still in the middle of fighting the war in Afghanistan."""
1,He again stressed that Britain would need to see evidence before it became involved in military action in other countries.
1,"""In terms of the war on terrorism we have always said this is a multi-faceted campaign but equally we have also said any future military action would have to be based on evidence,"" he said."
1,"This is not a reverse, it\'s actually an advance,"" he added."
1,"Hours after the vanguard entered from the west, a tank column halted its advance from the east, fearing hostile fire."
1,"""This campaign is not over."
0,"""There are some talks and negotiations going on there (in Kandahar) with the Taliban to surrender themselves,"" Gen Mohammed Zaer Azimi said in Herat."
0,SAS [Special Air Service] soldiers and their American counterparts are fighting alongside the Alliance as they have swept across large swathes Afghanistan.
1,"The surrender took days to hammer out, primarily because hard core Taliban and foreign troops from Usama Bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida terror network did not want to give up."
1,"""It is not at all a secure environment,"" he told the programme."
1,"But Commons Leader Mr Cook said: ""If you look back over the past month there has been no situation in which we have put British troops into the ground civil war and I don\'t myself imagine that\'s going to change."""
1,"British troops remained on 48 hour stand-by but the situation was ""better than anybody could have hoped for"", according to Mr Cook."
0,"However, night fell before the Alliance could secure the city, increasing the danger of militants fighting back."
1,"Ruud Lubbers, the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, said Afghanistan was not yet secure for aid agencies to operate in and ""not enough"" food had been taken into the country."
0,"Regular British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, Robin Cook signalled tonight."

1,"With these three musketeers [a reference to the three-party coalition government], this country can only be dragged along, but won\'t get anywhere."""
1,"It delivered that blow, and hit Argentina."
1,"Hatiboglu began a press conference he held at the TBMM [Turkish Grand National Assembly] by saying that ""I hope that Mr. [State Minister for the Economy Kemal] Dervis will not have the same fate as [former Argentine Economics Minister Domingo] Cavallo, and that our country\'s fate will not be the same as Argentina\'s."""

1,"Though some of them did not conceal their criticisms of Hugo Chavez, the member countries of the organization of American States (OAS) condemned the coup d'etat and recognized the legitimacy of the elected president."
1,"But the attacks that hit the United States that same day initiated a new era, relegating the defense of democratic principles to a subordinate place behind the priority objective of combating terrorism."
1,"Of course the American Administration had had contacts with the conspirators for several months, but that was in order to advise them to use constitutional methods against Chavez."
1,"From Mexico to Buenos Aires, television viewers saw, on the Spanish CNN and Telemundo channels, the undisguised pleasure displayed by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice at the announcement of Hugo Chavez\'s ""resignation,"" which he never in fact signed."
1,"From the vantage point of Latin America and the Caribbean, there can be no doubt about the United States' complicity with the military and civilian authors of the abortive coup d'etat against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez."

1,"Following the sudden turnabout and President Chavez's return to the Miraflores Palace after 48 hours, Washington immediately tried to limit the damage."
1,"His visits to Iraq\'s Saddam Husayn and Libya\'s Muammar al-Qadhdhafi, his friendship with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, his relations with the Colombian guerrillas, his speeches against ""neo-liberal globalization,"" and his commitment to a multipolar world already placed him in the Evil camp, even though the Bolivarian Venezuela has never ceased to guarantee oil supplies to United States, of which it is one of the three foremost suppliers."
1,"Beyond Latin America, the establishment of a ""friendly"" government in Caracas, representing industry and the conservative circles influenced by Opus Dei, also had the advantage for Washington of weakening OPEC, which Hugo Chavez had succeeded in bringing back to life less than two years ago."
1,"Far from condemning that which the United States at no time described as a coup d\'etat, President Bush\'s spokesman explained that Chavez had indeed brought it on himself and that he bore the responsibility for the ""confused events,"" having violated human rights."
1,"A former Ambassador to Venezuela, he has never made a secret of his antipathy for Chavez, who he rightly considers the main supporter of the Castro regime."

0,"Having taken a downward turn following the announcement of the coup d'etat, oil prices have started to rise again since Hugo Chavez's return to the Miraflores Palace."
1,"This apparent change of doctrine on Washington's part, following some 20 years of demands -- sometimes successful -- for observance of democratic and constitutional order in Latin America, is laden with threats, in a subcontinent which, during the second half of the last century, experienced a succession of coups d'etat, from Guatemala to Chile, via the Dominican Republican and Argentina, fomented or backed by the CIA and the Pentagon."
1,"On top of this, there are the latest press reports of the presence of one or two American officers among the conspirators..."
1,"Latin American analysts and commentators read in the New York Times and the Miami Herald that ""subtle and informal messages"" of encouragement had been addressed to the conspirators, as was admitted by an unidentified Pentagon official, and that the CIA was not inactive during the months prior to the coup d\'etat, as suggested by Stratfor , a newsletter specializing in intelligence matters and published on the Internet."
1,One of the first decisions by the government that resulted from the coup d'etat was indeed to suspend oil supplies to Cuba.
0,"The same advice was issued by the US Ambassador in Caracas, Charles Shapiro, who rushed to the presidential palace, with his Spanish opposite number, to meet with Pedro Carmona."
1,But he also took the risk that an obsession -- Fidel Castro's downfall -- would exert excessive influence on the conduct of relations with his neighbors in the South.
1,"By entrusting the conduct of his Latin American policy to the radical wing of anti-Castro exiles, President George W. Bush satisfied the powerful Cuban-American lobby of Miami, which his brother, Jeb, needs in order to secure his reelection as Governor of Florida."
1,"In the new Manichean world, divided between friends and enemies of the sole superpower, Hugo Chavez was unwise enough to condemn the American bombing raids in Afghanistan."
1,The conspicuous policy of playing games that US officials continue to adopt in their statements proves that the Bush administration is playing the part of a thug who is feared by all and who likes to punish anyone that complains about his behavior.
1,"The return of Chavez following the failed coup attempts that the United States first blessed and then disavowed represented a tough blow to US policy in Latin America, which is also known as America's backyard."
1,"Of course, she knew who should learn a lesson from this situation, but she was playing games."
1,"National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice stated after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez triumphantly returned to power at the request of his own people that she hoped Chavez got the message that his people had sent to him, which is that his policies are not useful to the Venezuelan people."
1,"Oddly enough, the peoples that US officials like to speak for are the same ones that suffer from unfair US policies, not to mention that those peoples never gave US politicians the right to speak for them."
1,It proved that the will of the people is stronger than any force or arrogance of power.
1,"It is worth mentioning that the United States is currently implementing the principle that President George Bush announced following the 11 September attacks, which is that those who are not with him are against him."
1,"Moreover, US officials have developed a habit of speaking for other peoples and their interests."
1,It is certainly playing games.
1,"For instance, Mr. Bush announced recently that Palestinian President Yasir Arafat has betrayed the hopes of his people."
1,"That is why the coup was planned to overthrow Chavez, who visited Iraq and considered suspending oil exports for one month in protest against the Israeli holocaust against Palestinian civilians."
1,"Overshadowed by the midst of the tragic events taking place in the occupied Palestinian areas, Venezuela's strong slap on the face of the United States has gone almost unrecognized."
1,I found the statements made by US officials about the recent developments in Venezuela both ridiculous and odd because they all seemed to be playing games.
1,It continues to twist the logic of things by turning a blind eye to Israeli murderers and describing Palestinian victims as terrorists.
1,The United States does not want to learn the lesson.
1,"Venezuelans' level of optimism is currently the same reported in 1998; that is, they are feeling pessimistic."

1,"According to this, only 20 percent believe the rich and powerful are against Chavez."
1,"As for the second factor, 43 percent find nothing positive in the government's actions."

0,"This November, his disapproval rating reached 58 percent and his approval rating, 33 percent."
1,The fact that two-thirds of Venezuelans consider Chavez responsible for the country's problems shows that he is losing strength in the third aspect of stability: The President's ability to keep hope is shrinking.
1,"In perfect agreement with the latest polls on the popularity of President Hugo Chavez, the most recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the resounding and sustained fall of the approval rating the President had at the beginning of his administration."
1,"Popular support for [Caracas Mayor Alfredo) Pena climbed from 5.5 to 16.8 percent."""

1,"According to Datanalisis' November poll, 57.4 percent of those polled feel as bad or worse than in the past and 55.3 percent believe their main problems are in the economic area."
1,Four of every 10 Venezuelans are blaming this problem on him.
1,Chavez' strengths include his personal qualities (27 percent) and clear desire to work (17 percent).
0,"If the elections were held tomorrow, Chavez would still win, but his lead collapsed from 40 to 24 percent."
1,The most telling result is that more than half of those polled believe that it is necessary to remove Chavez from office to solve the crisis.
1,"To the president's misfortune, 80 percent of Venezuelans believe there is a solution for the unemployment problem."
1,"The third is the perception of the President as an incapable leader, which is already happening, and the fourth is that Venezuelans are able to find a substitute leader."

1,"And, most of all -- this is a very important detail in this case -- the Convention forces the country that holds prisoners of war to release them immediately when the conflict is over."
1,"According to interpretations on which the individual in question refused to comment, Condoleezza Rice, the US President's national security adviser, played an important role in supporting Powell's opinion."
1,"Eventually, making a sum of the proposals offered by his main advisers, President Bush admitted on Monday, following the National Security Council meeting, that the captives at Guantanamo Bay will be covered under the ""spirit of the Geneva Convention,"" even if their special status comes from the fact that they will continue to be designated terrorists, rather than prisoners of war."
1,"Following his recent world tours, Powell suggested that the President accept the validity of the Geneva Convention for the pro-Taliban detainees."
1,"In all likelihood, President Bush made that statement on 18 January following a consultation -- which was ""rather brief,"" some US observers believe -- with Ashcroft, who was strongly supported by Cheney."
1,"Sometimes the criticism was unexpectedly tough: Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said ""the US Government cannot choose to wage war in Afghanistan with guns, bombs and soldiers, and then assert the laws of war do not apply."""
1,The fact that the President reconsidered his own statement of 18 January led to diverse reactions.
1,"In other words, he admitted he had been wrong -- and that at time when opinion polls in the United States are, without exception, very favorable to him."
1,"Therefore, even if Powell agrees with the refusal to grant prisoner-of-war status to the 158 captives, he believe that the US refusal to cover the captives under the Geneva Convention would set a precedent that could affect the fate of US soldiers sent out to risky areas of this planet."
1,"Therefore, the dispute of opinions in the administration became a lesson in applied democracy."
1,"In this concern about details -- about cold-blood accomplices to murder, because that is what these al-Qa'ida disciples at Guantanamo Bay are -- the US Administration proves it is capable of admitting it is not infallible, which is the equivalent of respect for democracy."
1,"And, as a last detail, let us remember that, harassed everywhere by journalists and commentators, no US leader ever thought of finding ""monkeys"" [reference to a statement made by Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase] among media workers or scapegoats among the weirdoes who use hundreds of websites to call on the administration to stop supporting the Jews or to exterminate the Arabs."
1,"As for their possible repatriation, it cannot be taken into consideration, as long as the war against terrorism is far from over."
1,"The United States wanted this very much, because so far the identity and citizenship of those they call ""terrorists"" (or ""killers"" in Bush\'s languages without nuances) rather than prisoners in a conventional war have not been published for reasons that are easy to understand."
1,"There is irony -- including from the sober The New York Times , which wrote in its Tuesday issue that in his Monday speech the President ""twice called the 158 pro-Taliban fighters \'prisoners,\' then stopped himself, and used the word \'detainees.\'"""
1,"This is about the following: on 18 January 2002, President Bush publicly announced two decisions, which, owing to the President's firmness in announcing them, seemed unyielding: first, the President said the 158 pro-Taliban fighters brought to Guantanamo Bay were not defined by US courts as prisoners of war; therefore, the United States does not believe it is its duty to grant them prisoner-of-war rights under the Geneva Convention, which regulates (since 1949) the status of this category of detained combatants."
0,President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell also participated in this business.
1,"Obviously, this decision simplified things, and it allowed the US judiciary to conduct the investigation of the 158 detainees as it sees fit."
1,"The issue at stake was apparently simple: the status of the detainees, members of al-Qa'ida and Taliban fighters captured by US troops in Afghanistan in recent months and recently transferred to a detention base at Guantanamo Bay."
1,"In a first phase, the rest of the administration was baffled by Powell's opinion, but shortly afterward Rumsfeld sided with him, supporting his proposal in front of the President."
0,"These were some of the leaders called to express their opinions: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Vice President Dick Cheney, John Ashcroft (general prosecutor and chief of the Justice Department), CIA Director George Tenet, General Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others."
1,"Saudi Arabia alone says ""more than 100"" of the 158 are Saudi citizens (a figure the Americans see as exaggerated), and Saudi Interior Minister Prince Saud Nayif recently said that his country would like to have them repatriated, to be tried at home."
1,The surprise -- for the US administration and the US media -- came with a statement made by Powell.
1,"According to information circulated by the main US newspapers, the detainees are citizens of 25 countries, including England, France, Australia, Yemen, Algeria, and even Sweden (!)."
1,"At first sight, this seems to be nothing more than a terminology issue."
1,"Eventually, President Bush agreed to reconsider some of the decisions he had announced a short time previously."
0,"In the actual situation we are discussing, the issue is the privileges ensured by the Convention: according to that act, no detained combatant can be forced to reveal to the interrogator anything other than his name, rank, military serial number, and birth date."
1,"On Monday 28 January, the US National Security Council convened for an uncomfortable meeting; the main issue to be debated was known as early as the week before, following an unprecedented split that had emerged in the US Administration."
1,"According to his own assertions, the obvious concern of some Western European leaders -- US allies -- and of some important European governmental and non-governmental institutions about the treatment the detainees are being subjected to, especially following the publication of certain images of the Guantanamo Bay camp that could be interpreted in various ways, played a key role in this position."
0,The Guantanamo Bay has been in U.S. hands since the Spanish- American War in 1898.

1,"President Vicente Fox of Mexico took a strong stand, saying his \ncountry would not recognize Venezuela's new government until \nelections were held."
1,"The attorney general, Isa? Rodr?ez, also said Mr. Chavez had \nnot resigned, but was forced out by military officers."
0,"Mr. Carmona, the president of Fedeca-iras, a business \nassociation, said early today that Mr. Chavez had ""presented his \nresignation."""
1,"Mr. Chavez's daughter, Mar?Gabriela, speaking in an interview \non state television in Cuba, said that her father had not \nresigned."
1,"Officials portrayed the \nouster as a victory for democracy, even though Mr. Chavez was a \nlegitimately elected president."
1,He promised that they would receive government \nbenefits.
1,"Mr. Carmona said that ""justice must be done"" for the families of \nthose killed."
1,"He was wrong about \nthe solutions and the Venezuelan people made that very clear."""
1,The Bush administration laid the blame for Mr. Chavez's \noverthrow firmly with the ousted leader.
1,"""We know that the action encouraged by the Chavez government \nprovoked this crisis,"" said Ari Fleischer, the White House \nspokesman."
1,"However, Latin American leaders at a summit meeting in Costa \nRica criticized Mr. Chavez\'s ouster as an ""interruption of the \nconstitutional order."""
0,"The interim government quickly moved to undo Mr. Chavez's \npolicies, dissolving the National Assembly controlled by his \nsupporters, firing members of the Supreme Court and changing the \ncountry's official name back to the Republic of Venezuela."
1,"Among Mr. Carmona's most pressing tasks now will be to assuage \nconcerns in other countries about how Mr. Chavez's reign ended \nand deal with the polarization between rich and poor that \ndivides this country, analysts familiar with Venezuela said."
1,"The Chavez government, he added, suppressed a \npeaceful demonstration and fired on unarmed protesters."
1,"He spoke flanked by military officers who had \nrebelled against Mr. Chavez on Thursday night, the third day of \na general strike called by his opponents."
0,"On the streets of this sprawling capital, opponents of the \ngovernment took to the streets in the early morning hours, \nhonking horns and waving the gold, blue and red of the \nVenezuelan flag."
1,"For now, the government focused on clearing up the events \nleading to the violence of Thursday afternoon, remembering the \nfallen and searching for those who were responsible."
1,It had been crippled when office and production \nworkers began staging work slowdowns last week in protest.
0,Mr. \nChavez had renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic of \nVenezuela.
0,Venezuela's Chief Forced to Resign; Civilian Installed
1,"It was established in 1903, \nserved as a World War II outpost against German U-Boats and has \nbeen an incessant irritant to Fidel Castro -- who tried to tear \nup a $2,000-a-year, 1934 lease agreement between Washington and \nHavana, to oust the American imperialists from the island."
1,My understanding is that they \nhave some capability in medical care in Cuba.
0,"``It is in our museum, we still have it,'' he said."
1,But Buehn said the Cubans have not raised any formal objections \nto the base's latest mission.
1,"And I can't speak for everybody on the \nbase but I think most people are glad to be part of it, excited \nby it."
1,Now he's still head honcho of the base itself.
1,"It's gotten so busy around this once-sleepy Caribbean outpost \nthat the man in charge may soon restore the stoplight that, \nuntil Navy downsizing in the 1990s, hung near the only McDonalds \nin all of Cuba."
1,Some might suspect it's a bit more dangerous now.
1,"Moreover, he labeled as ``a \nserious offer,'' a so-far spurned proposal by Havana to send \nmedical teams here to support the prison camp project."
1,"Until a Marine general arrived two weeks ago to run the prison \nproject, Buehn was the highest ranking officer here -- a cross \nbetween mayor, overseeing the schools, social clubs and 5K run \non Martin Luther King Day, and Navy commander, in charge of this \nstrategic air and sea refueling station."
1,But Buehn said \nthe new mission has given residents -- both civilians and \nservice members -- a sense of unity and purpose after the \nuncertainty of Sept. 11 left them sitting on the sidelines of \nthe U.S. war on international terror.
1,"He arrived here in 2000, and is \nnow presiding over a transformation of this suburban-style base \nthat, until its latest assignment, was a backwater of 2,400 \npeople -- 700 of them Navy and Marine members, the rest Jamaican \nand Filipino contract workers plus family members."
1,"So much so, he said, that \nnot a single family member or contractor has so far requested to \nleave here, the oldest U.S. base overseas, and the only one left \nin a communist country."
1,"We were the equivalent of a sleepy little \nfishing village,'' he said in an interview."
1,"GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba -- What a difference a terrorist \ndetention center makes."
1,"Yet, ``all in all we're glad to have an important mission and a \nplace to work to fit in the war on terrorism."
1,"In fact, tensions got so hot in 1962 that the base slipped Navy \nwives and kids onto a cargo ship and evacuated them during the \nCuban Missile Crisis."
1,"``I think it was a serious offer,'' he said of the overture, \nwhich some in Miami scorned as a publicity stunt."
1,"``As base commander, I've given a lot of thought about what the \nname Guantanamo Bay may conjure up in someone's mind."
0,"``It was \nright at Sherman Avenue, just a little bit this side of the \nMcDonalds."
1,"With a heavy layer of Marine and Army security, \ntheir safety is not a concern, he said."
1,I think time will \ntell how the name will be associated.
1,"Meanwhile, Buehn is wondering what the latest mission will do to \nGitmo's image."
0,"``Now in two weeks we've had 1,200 people drop in on us."
1,"``When I came down here, Gitmo had been downsized quite a bit \nand we were just maintaining our mission of being a refueling \nport and an airfield."
0,"Most residents on the windward side -- among \nthem, now, some 158 alleged terrorists flown in from \nAfghanistan."
0,"Born in Brevard County, Buehn is a Navy pilot whose rank of \ncaptain equals an Army colonel."
1,Gitmo's history is a storied one.
0,"``If we took \nthem up on it, they would help."
1,Commander of base sees a world of change
0,"Leeward is left to the single functioning air \nstrip, some Marines and overnight flight crews."
1,It's \nbecome like a boom town.
0,"Geographically the base is split by the bay, and united by a \nferry service."
0,"Were Washington to decide to maintain Guantanamo as an offshore \nterrorist detention center, Buehn said, he would propose \nbuilding a maximum security facility on leeward side."
0,"Fourteen months later, Castro cut off \nutilities to the base, compelling the U.S. Navy to install \nelectricity and desalination plants."
0,"And, he said, neither he nor Marine Brig. Gen. Michael Lehnert, \ncommander of the prison project, are considering the evacuation \nof sailors' wives and children, some of whom live not far from \nCamp X-Ray."
1,"Nor is there any worry over the infrastructure, which was \nstretched to the limit in 1994 and 1995 when the base became an \nencampment 55,000-plus Haitian and Cuban boat people -- and the \ncommander sent civilians stateside to make room for the 8,000 \nU.S. personnel who came to tend to the migrant project."
1,"Between the armored vehicles ferrying Taliban and al Qaeda \nprisoners to Camp X-Ray and the international observers whizzing \npast, it may be time to dust off the only traffic signal that \never operated on the 45-square-mile base, says Navy Capt. Robert \nA. Buehn."
1,"And, of \ncourse, I want it to be good things,'' he said, not ``like \nAlcatraz or Devil's Island."
1,"But he's not \ndirectly responsible for the nascent offshore U.S. terror \ncompound, which, depending on whether the Pentagon decides to \nstage military tribunals here, may one day make its nickname -- \nGitmo -- as notorious as Devil's Island."
0,"According to a study released last week by the Canadian \nManufacturers and Exporters, implementation of the 1997 Kyoto \nglobal warming treaty would cost our economy 450,000 jobs and as \nmuch as $40-billion."
1,"(Non-farming \nCanadians, most of whom spend at least part of the winter months \nscraping ice off their cars, chopping firewood and shovelling \ntheir walks, will profit as well.)"
1,The \nworldwide cost of that 8% dip: about $2-trillion in lost GDP -- \ngive or take a trillion.
1,Why Kyoto is a rip-off
1,"Even if Canada managed to convince the United States and every \nother Kyoto signatory to ratify the protocol, world carbon \ndioxide emissions would still soar."
0,"Without Kyoto, the figure would be 34%."
1,"But these problems can be abated, or \neven eliminated, with Western assistance."
1,Yet rising temperatures pose \nlittle threat to Canada.
1,"In its authoritative Feb., 2001, report \non the projected impacts of global warming, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identified several \nthreats to Canadian ecosystems, but concluded that our farmers \nwould generally benefit from warmer temperatures."
1,"""There is \nnothing to be gained by frightening people when all the facts \nare not known."""
0,"According to the U.S. Energy \nInformation Administration, world energy consumption will \nincrease by about 60% between now and 2020, with most of the \nupsurge expected to come from developing nations, which are not \ncovered by the Kyoto Protocol."
0,"Under the fully implemented \ntreaty, carbon dioxide emissions would grow 26% during the \n1990-2010 period."
1,This is not a price worth paying.
1,"While helping Third \nWorld nations plant new crops, vaccinate people and relocate \ncoastal towns will be costly, the bottom line will likely be \nonly a fraction of Kyoto's 13-digit price tag."
1,But Jean Chretien is not worried.
1,"But the $40-billion figure, far from being conceived to \n""frighten"" Canadians, is plucked straight from government \ndocuments."
1,"Governments are expected to \nprotect the national economy, and they should deviate from that \nmission only when crucial national interests are at stake \n(fighting terrorism, for example)."
1,Instead of trying to \ncap carbon dioxide emissions -- a costly burden at home and an \nimpossible task in the developing world -- we should focus on \nabating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations.
1,"As for the globally felt benefits that would follow from \nCanada's implementation of the Kyoto protocol, they are slight."
1,"""I don\'t \naccept these figures,"" the Prime Minister said."
1,There are better ways to spend that money.
1,"If \nscientists are correct, higher temperatures and rising sea \nlevels will depress grain yields in Africa and parts of Asia, \nfuel the spread of diseases, and threaten coastal nations such \nas Bangladesh and Senegal."
1,"According to a report released in 2000 by the \nNational Air Issues Co-ordinating Committee on Climate Change, a \ngroup staffed by officials from the federal, provincial and \nterritorial governments, hitting Canada\'s Kyoto target may mean \n""the loss of roughly one year\'s growth, or, viewed in absolute \nterms, in 2010, the loss in annual economic output of \napproximately $40-billion (or $1,100 per capita)."""
1,"By 2010, our $40-billion sacrifice would yield an expected \nreduction in annual carbon and carbon-equivalent emissions of \nabout 46-million tonnes -- just 1/200th of the world's total \nprojected greenhouse gas output."
0,Paratroopers return Chavez to power
1,"The majority of the population, who was not delighted with \nChavez, was not on their side as well."
0,"At the same, the \nVenezuela government declared that participants of the coup will \nbe brought to trial."
1,Vice-president Diosdado Cabello believes that the Venezuelan \ncoup was thoroughly planned beforehand.
1,It is hard to forecast the further development of the events in \nVenezuela.
1,"Vice-president Diosdado \nCabello, a Hugo Chavez supporter, is acting president as of now."
1,"He showed journalists \nproof of his statement: a president's belt, a symbol of power \nthat did not belong to Hugo Chavez."
1,There is no doubt that he will dismiss \ndisloyal top officers from the army.
1,What reforms will be initiated by Hugo Chavez next?
1,"Once again, events in Venezuela have drawn the close attention \nof the world's media."
1,Hugo Chavez managed to demonstrate astonishing \npolitical resistance.
1,Ordinary Venezuelans are \neven less happy with the generals and local oligarchic elite.
1,Time will \ntell if the president has really learnt a lesson from the \nsituation.
1,The belt had been especially \nmanufactured in Spain and was later left in the Miraflores \npresidential palace by the plotters.
1,"Protesters, who ousted Hugo Chavez at the end \nof the previous week, failed to gain the support of the army."
0,Carmona and \nother generals who participated in the coup are now being \nquestioned by public prosecutors.
0,The ousted president was freed by paratroopers.
1,"There were already several \nsuppositions that Hugo Chavez may recover the position, but \nnobody could suppose the recovery would be so quick."
1,Chavez supporters say that no witch-hunting will follow and the \nopposition should not be afraid of persecution.
1,"Indeed, it was clear since the very beginning that Pedro \nCarmona, who proclaimed himself interim president would care \nvery little for improving ordinary people's lives."
1,"As for ordinary \nVenezuelans, they seem to be slightly anxious about the struggle \nfor the presidential post."
1,Hugo Chavez is very likely to be soon return to the post of \npresident of Venezuela.
0,Chavez himself \nused to be in command of a paratrooper unit.
1,"Hugo Chavez is not the formal president yet, as he had to resign \nunder the pressure of the plotters."
1,Venezuelan paratroopers are \nevidently to profit from the situation.
1,He has been \npatronizing his subordinates during his entire presidency and \nwas finally rewarded for his support: the paratroopers helped \nhim regain power.
0,Neither supporters nor opponents of \nChavez could be seen in the streets during the days of the coup.
1,"Hardly had observers even time to get used \nto the news that Hugo Chavez had lost his presidential post, and \nthen he returned to power."
1,The planners \ncommitted one more mistake when they dissolved the National \nAssembly and Supreme Court right after the coup.
1,"Chavez says that he has learnt a lesson from the events, and he \nwill be more attentive to the opposition's opinion in the \nfuture."
1,"For starters, there's a wariness among economists that an \nexpected 30 to 40 percent devaluation could spark a return to \nthe chaotic days of the late 1980s, when 5,000-percent inflation \nwas rampant."
1,Argentina braces for currency fall
1,But that's exactly \nwhat Duhalde most lacks.
1,"But some analysts are \nconcerned that Duhalde will follow it up with a return to the \nprotectionism and failed policies that dominated the country's \neconomy for half of this past century, until ex-President Carlos \nMenem changed course last decade and ushered in an era of \nstability."
1,"Already, everything from bread to computer parts \nhas been marked up by as much as 20 percent in anticipation of \nthe devaluation."
1,"""He\'s not just steering the economy into disaster, but he\'s \nbreaking fundamental concepts like right to savings and the rule \nof law,"" says Abel Viglione, senior economist at local think \ntank Fiel."
1,"Instead of blaming globalization, most Argentines point to \ncorrupt politicians and indifferent institutions for \nprecipitating the current crisis."
1,"But at a time when the country is desperate for investment and \ninternational aid to prevent an economic crisis from exploding \nfurther, it is unclear how far Duhalde could actually turn back \nthe clock even if he wanted to."
1,But few expect the government's plan for reviving the country's \nmoribund economy to elicit much support abroad.
1,"""No matter what economic policy is in place, that \nsort of trust takes several years, if not an entire generation, \nto rebuild."""
1,For such an ambitious economic program to work requires a strong \nleader with popular support to implement it.
1,"A weekend poll by Aresco consultancy showed 52 \npercent of Argentines ""highly"" in favor of Duhalde\'s stated \neconomic plans and another 34 percent giving him ""medium"" \napproval - an indication of public confidence."
1,"Although he's so far successfully \nrallied the country's political class behind him, Duhalde, a \nformer vice president to Menem and two-time governor of Buenos \nAires province, has been dogged by allegations of corruption \nthroughout his career."
1,"Otherwise, the country's cash-strapped banks, which are being \nforced to accept lesser-valued pesos for loans made almost \nentirely in dollars, will collapse."
1,"The party, founded by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron in the 1940s, has \nlong dominated Argentine politics, thanks to a deft mix of \npopulist policies, nationalist rhetoric, and political \npatronage."
1,"""They want to hold us \nhostage and force us to buy goods that can be bought cheaper and \nbetter quality imported."""
1,"Despite widespread fatigue caused by successive \nausterity drives, such as limiting bank withdrawals to $1,000 \nper month, the overwhelming majority of Argentines still prefer \nthe stability of the current economic model - despite its many \nshortcomings - to the disorder of a closed economy."
1,"Surveys show that more than 70 percent of the public opposes any \nchanges to convertibility, as the currency regime is known."
1,"Duhalde's embrace of the past can be partly explained by the \nnature of the Peronists themselves, whom Argentine literary \ngiant Jorge Luis Borges once referred to as neither good nor \nbad, just incorrigible."
1,But now a different variety of nostalgia appears to be emerging.
1,"His reputation as an old-style party boss \nwas behind his defeat at the polls in 1999, when he posted the \nworst showing ever by a Peronist presidential candidate."
1,"The man whom some economists say is leading the step backward in \ntime is the country's new president, Eduardo Duhalde, \nArgentina's fifth in two weeks."
1,"To contain inflation and fill an expected $11 billion budget \ndeficit this year, government officials say a rescue package of \nat least $15 billion is needed from the IMF and other lenders."
1,"In fact, quite \nthe contrary."
1,It was approved overwhelmingly by the lower house of \nCongress late Saturday and was expected to be passed by the \nSenate yesterday.
1,"Everyone from the International Monetary Fund in Washington to \nthe traditional protectionists in Buenos Aires thought \ndevaluation was necessary, if painful."
1,The government is \nalso taking heat for its plans to violate privatization \ncontracts signed a decade ago and unilaterally lower the rates \nmostly foreign-owned utilities can charge for public services \nlike water and gas.
1,"Even before its \nfaltering economy produced an epic-sized default, and the \ncountry was thrust into its worst crisis since democracy was \nrestored in 1983, Argentines were obsessed with their past \ntriumphs."
1,"""Those who want to devalue are shameless,"" says Maria Estevez, a \nschoolteacher who earns $600 a month."
1,Already a swarm of powerful lobbies representing foreign \ncompanies have descended on Buenos Aires to fight government \nplans to introduce price and capital controls.
1,But the stiffest opposition may yet come from the Argentines \nthemselves.
1,"After four years of crippling \nrecession, Duhalde and others are questioning whether \nArgentina's decade-long pursuit of free market reforms is the \nright solution."
1,BUENOS AIRES - Nostalgia runs deep in Argentina.
1,With his appointment by Congress last Wednesday to finish the \ntwo years left in the term vacated by ex-President Fernando de \nla R?he Peronist Duhalde is now promoting a number of \nemergency measures that would turn back the clock on liberal \neconomic reforms.
1,"Some call it the Ford Falcon syndrome, a reference to the \nclassic gas-guzzler that inefficient Argentine automakers \ncontinued to turn out in droves 20 years after it disappeared \nfrom US showrooms."
1,"""He must think he can defy gravity, because he\'s pursuing the \nsame crash course that Argentines and the rest of Latin America \nrejected a decade ago,"" says Christopher Ecclestone, head of \ninvestment boutique Buenos Aires Trust."
1,"On Friday, President Duhalde asked Congress for broad new powers \nto end the country's decade-old currency regime that pegs the \npeso to the US dollar, to intervene in the banking system, to \ninstitute price controls, and to protect local industry and \njobs."
0,"He said 80 MDC rallies had been stopped by ZANU-PF militias or \nthe police since the presidential campaign began two months ago, \nleaving him to address 10 major meetings compared with the 50 by \nMr. Mugabe, who has barnstormed around the country."
1,"""The government of Zimbabwe continues its blatant campaign of \nviolence, intimidation and manipulation of the electoral process \nin an effort to win the poll."
1,"At his rally, Mr. Mugabe blamed the MDC for the violence."

1,The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said 40 of \nits polling agents were briefly abducted by government \nsupporters in what it called the latest intimidation intended to \nsteal the election.

1,They just wanted more \nconsultations.
1,His boss apparently has less business sense.
1,"In short, because \nthe estimates of the scale and timing of atmospheric warming are \nso uncertain, it is just not possible to assess the costs and \nbenefits."
1,Underlying the uncertainties regarding costs are more \nfundamental uncertainties about the scientific evidence.
1,"Ten days ago, when asked about Kyoto at the now famous Team \nCanada press conference in Moscow, Premier Ralph Klein produced \na letter indicating that all the premiers, except the \never-distinct Quebec, opposed Kyoto."
0,"Because \nof the three-dimensional nature of the problem, doubling the \nresolution requires 16 times the computer power."

0,"To get the \ncubes down to a useful size -- around 20 miles a side -- would \ntake computers about 1,000 times as powerful as are currently \navailable."
1,"Taylor may have offered a more prudent guess, but the fact is, \naccurate estimates of the costs of policies designed to reduce \nselected gas emissions are impossible."
1,"Canadians know, with a certainty \napproaching perfection, that the federal government is \nincompetent when it comes to offering even order-of-magnitude \nguesses."
1,"A few days later in Munich, \nprovincial opposition was hedged with qualifications: The NDP \npremiers of Saskatchewan and Manitoba apparently thought the \n""principles"" of Kyoto were fine."
1,"At the same conference, Taylor's federal counterpart, David \nAnderson, announced that the Alberta numbers were absurd."
0,It would cost Alberta somewhere between \n$3-billion and $6-billion.
1,"Second, there is no evidence on the net impact of human \nactivity."
1,Swelling the \npopulation of envirocrats in Ottawa means that the sole \nbeneficiary is the federal government.
1,"No one knows the impact \non Canada's international competitiveness, when China, India, \nBrazil, and Indonesia are not committed to reduce anything."

1,"No \none can estimate the costs or benefits of developing novel \nenergy sources because, if new knowledge could be known in \nadvance, it wouldn't be new."
1,Another sign the debate is intensifying emerged last week at a \nglobal warming conference in Ottawa.
1,"Even if they existed, there is no reliable baseline from which \nto begin: No one knows what global weather was really like in \n1900 or 1850 to say nothing of earlier dates."

1,"Argentina, however, was determined to pay its debts in full and \nkeep its fixed currency in place, fulfilling what it viewed as a \npromise to its citizens and creditors who had been told for \nyears that pesos were as good as dollars."
1,The chances of contagion are now \nviewed as minimal.
1,"It is always a tough call to cut off aid, Mr. Calomiris said."
1,"When Argentina's crisis worsened in recent weeks, Bush \nadministration officials did not take a firm position, allowing \nthe I.M.F. to make the call on withholding additional loans, \npeople involved in the fund's deliberations said."
1,But many say the monetary fund should have called \ngovernment officials to account sooner.
1,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 - The deadly riots in Argentina, the \ncollapse of its government and another multibillion dollar \nbailout gone awry have raised fresh questions about the \neffectiveness of the International Monetary Fund and the \nfinancial policies of the United States, the fund's leading \nshareholder."
1,"But he argued that by delaying, the fund helped Argentina dig \nitself into a deeper hole."
1,"But he said that he disagreed with the decision by the fund and \nthe Bush administration to continue the aid program in August, \nwhen he said the situation in Argentina had likely deteriorated \nbeyond repair."
1,"Others say the fund made the \nopposite mistake, repeatedly offering loans to Argentina despite \nindications that the country's policies had become unworkable, \ndelaying the day of reckoning."
1,"Backed by both the Clinton and Bush administrations, the I.M.F. \ntwice came to the rescue, beginning late last year."
1,"The difficulty, of course, is that such calls are much easier to \nmake in hindsight."

1,It outlined strict \nfiscal policies that it claimed would allow it to meet its \nobligations.
1,"Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill came into office publicly \ndenouncing multibillion dollar bailouts, saying that either they \nfail outright or they allow foreign governments to get away with \nbad policymaking and investors to get away with bad bets."
1,"Peru's finance minister, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, complained today \nthat the fund bungled its dealings with Argentina by adopting \ninconsistent policies that were at turns passive and inflexible."
1,"""If Argentina got its core economic policies right, it would \nhave avoided this problem,"" said Charles Calomiris, a finance \nand economics professor at Columbia University who has been \nsounding the alarm about Argentina for months."

1,Argentina's Chaos Raises New Doubts on Monetary Fund
1,"Latin American and European government leaders today joined \nprotesters in Buenos Aires, Wall Street traders and financial \nexperts in putting at least part of the blame for Argentina's \nproblems on the lending agency and the Clinton and Bush \nadministrations."
1,Argentina adopted a strict fixed- currency regime and overhauled \nits banks in the early 1990's.
0,Fund officials say privately that they cannot avoid financial \nbailouts altogether.
1,The terms of the aid program were wrenching.
1,"But subsequent governments allowed spending to grow out of \ncontrol, building up a foreign debt that became impossible to \nmaintain."
1,"""The fund made a mistake in not saying no in August,"" Mr. Mussa \nsaid."
1,"""The fund is partly to blame for this because the fund did not \nsound the alarm in time and then took a very hard line when \nthings were incredibly difficult,"" he told Peruvian radio."
1,"Mr. Mussa acknowledged that even when the \npolitical and economic situation in Argentina was more stable, a \nmove to delay debt payments or devalue the currency ran the risk \nof rattling financial markets and even causing a financial \nimplosion in the region."
1,The fund \ndecided to suspend aid for a program that appeared to have \nlittle chance of success.
1,"He has also backed \ntwo large rescue packages for Turkey, a strategic ally that has \nfaced tough financial problems."
1,"Though there were unique elements, Argentina's demise seems \ncertain to add to the doubts about the wisdom of bailouts, \ndoubts that have grown in recent years."
1,"""If you do not show leadership and make it happen early, then \nyou face a catastrophe,"" he said."
1,"At an August meeting at I.M.F. headquarters, fund officials told \nDomingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, that the country \nwould be better off delaying debt payments."
1,"Moreover, it is difficult to place blame for Argentina's \neconomic program squarely on the fund when much of the policy \nwas designed by Argentina itself, sometimes over the objections \nof the fund's economists."
1,"In contrast, by watching Argentina wrestle with its finances \nover a period of months, financial markets anticipated the \npossibility of a default."
0,Argentina also fell into a deep recession four years \nago.
1,"In practice, however, the Bush administration has yet to take a \nclear stance on such bailouts and has made international \nfinancial policy a low priority."
1,"It tamed inflation and became, \nfor a spell, a glowing economic success story."
1,The government \nagreed to slash spending during a deep recession to increase the \nchances of making debt payments on schedule.
1,"""The situation might have been more controllable then."""
1,"The French, who like the \nUnited States are significant fund shareholders, have called on \nthe lending agency to step up its involvement to help Argentina \nrecover."
1,"After some hand-wringing about jeopardizing the money of \nAmerican ""plumbers and carpenters,"" Mr. O\'Neill supported a \nmultibillion loan for Argentina in August."
1,"But by December, as Mr. Cavallo resorted to freezing bank \naccounts and raiding pension funds to find enough hard currency \nto make debt payments, collapse looked imminent."
1,The government beseeched the I.M.F. for help to stay \nsolvent as it tried to work through its problems.
1,"The idea was to help the country defend its fixed currency, \nwhich had become a political touchstone, while avoiding default \non $132 billion in foreign debt, allowing it to continue good \nrelations with foreign investors."
1,"The lesson of Argentina, they say, is that \nthey need to find a way to say no before the people they are \nsupposed to be helping take to the streets."
1,"Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister, assailed the I.M.F. \nfor abandoning a longtime client and imposing ""demands that have \nbeen excessive or at the wrong time."""
1,"Some say the monetary fund showed callousness by failing to give \nnew aid to Argentina early this month, as the country's economic \nprogram, designed with I.M.F. approval, was forcing painful \nausterity measures on its citizens."

1,"Come to think of it, acquiring weapons of mass destruction per \nse may not be a correct basis for judging whether a nation is \ngood or evil."

1,Elaborating on the 'axis of evil
1,Perhaps the real criterion in this context is whether the \nnuclear country is democratic in every sense of the word.
1,"PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush\'s National Security Adviser Condoleezza \nRice has recently ""defined"" the context and scope of the term \n""axis of evil"" that Bush used in his State of the Union address \na few weeks ago to describe Iraq, Iran and North Korea."
1,"All other countries which are seemingly \nrefraining from acquiring such weapons are doing so not so much \nto escape being branded as ""evil"" but rather because they have \nneither the knowledge nor the money to join the ""nuclear club""."
1,"After all, the US is the first nation to have \ndeveloped nuclear weapons."
1,"On this count, the national security adviser may \nhave erred."
1,One can name more than a dozen countries which are \ncontemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one \nspeed or another.
1,"Washington seems to be particularly disturbed and feel that its \nown national security is being threatened only when the nations \nwhich acquire mass destruction weapons are authoritarian or \nrepressive, irrespective of the pace of amassing weaponry."
1,"Moreover, the US is the first and \nonly nation ever to deploy such weapons."
1,"This \nis, in fact, the fear of all countries, as they feel that \ndemocratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it \ncomes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction."
1,"If this is \nthe case, Rice could have elaborated more precise criteria for \nmembership in the ""axis of evil,"" by establishing more clearly \nthe connection between the nature of the regime and the \nacquisition of weapons of mass destruction."
1,"The rule, as far as human rights are concerned, is \nthat every nation which does not enjoy pluralistic democracy is \nviolating human rights and is therefore oppressive."
1,"In other \nwords, countries which are seeking or developing such arsenal at \na slow pace do not seem to come within the scope of the ""axis of \nevil""."
1,"By all conservative estimates, there are scores of other \ncountries which can easily qualify as repressive and violating \nhuman rights."
1,"As for her wording regarding acquisition of weapons, what is \nparticularly noteworthy is the use of the words ""aggressively \nseeking"" nuclear, biological or chemical weapons."
1,The mere development or possession of mass \ndestruction weapons is not in itself a reason to label a state \nas evildoer.

1,"""President Bush never talked about specific steps he expected \nthe Argentine government to take,"" said one White House official \nfamiliar with Mr. Bush\'s periodic calls and letters to Mr. de la \nR?d the series of his successors in recent weeks."
1,"Still, Mr. Bush's reaction to the biggest international economic \ncrisis so far in his presidency is a telling example of a new - \nand perhaps risky - approach to the kind of national economic \nbankruptcies that dominated Washington's dealings with the \nworld's emerging markets in the late 1990's."
1,"When Argentina barreled toward a similar default in recent \nweeks, it was Mr. Bush who had to make the bailout call - and \nhis decision was to let Argentina suffer the consequences of its \nown economic mismanagement."

1,"It \nis a message that Mr. Bush's aides said in interviews this week \nthat they hoped would force officials of developing countries \nand foreign investors to work out their problems without relying \nas much on huge aid packages from the International Monetary \nFund and from Washington, which became commonplace after Mexico."
1,Both left-wing anti-globalization \nactivists and some conservative economists have argued that the \nfund became too interventionist during the Clinton years.

1,But administration and I.M.F. officials respond that they aided \nArgentina for as long as they thought there was a reasonable \nchance that its political leaders were serious about reform.

1,"In his conversation with Secretary of State Colin Powell, the Brazilian Foreign Minister stated clearly that to leave Argentina to its own fate, as seems to be the George Bush administration's choice, is to pave the way for social rebellion there, which will contaminate other countries on the continent and create another area of political instability on the planet."

1,"Translating roughly, what Minister Lafer tried to tell the Americans is that the financial cost of an international rescue of Argentina, now, led by the IMF and other multilateral credit agencies, will be lower than the cost of fighting, later on, chaos in its social, political, and - why not? - military forms on the continent."

1,It is interesting that the U.S. State Department's annual global human rights report came this year at a time when Washington itself is being sharply criticized by most countries and international human rights organizations for the killing of a large number of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the torture and inhuman treatment of the Taleban and Al-Qaeda prisoners at its military base at Guantanamo Bay.

1,Among the unfounded allegations was the claim that the Islamic Republic enjoys no social base and is an unpopular system because of its human rights violations.
1,"Indeed, the U.S Administration, which claims to advocate international human rights issues and which tries to play the role of a world policeman, is actually condoning the most atrocious human rights violations committed in the United States itself."

1,Such wishful thinking risks making the US an accomplice in the destruction of human rights.

0,Question: How do you assess the sudden downfall and more sudden return of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela?
1,Answer: The Venezuelan experience during the past few days showed that regimes that are based on the votes and support of the masses and adopt relatively independent policies toward the big powers and especially America are not favored by the American leadership.
1,"But undoubtedly there are basic doubts that exist about the coup and America's immediate support, and what springs to mind is the great possibility of some countries' intervention in Venezuela's domestic affairs."
1,Answer: The incidents and developments in Venezuela and Chavez's return to power were so rapid that the possibility of intervention by other powers in his return to power is very small.

0,"We asked Ali Kianushrad, member of the Majles National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, to state his views on the recent developments in Venezuela, Chavez's removal, and his return to power."
1,The Americans' hasty and immediate support for the coup shows that the Americans are in no way in favor of national and independent rules coming to power.
1,"Answer: We have good relations with Venezuela, and there was no reason for us to be satisfied in any way with the overthrow the rule there, especially when the Venezuelan regime's policies enjoy the extensive support of the Venezuelan people and when there are points un its independent policies on oil that converge with our policies and have been positively assessed by the Islamic Republic of Iran."

1,Certain American people also maintain that the US way of treating the prisoners is not reproachable.
1,They shall be tried with US soldiers in the same court for war crime.
0,The camp's temperature has exceeded 32 degrees Celsius.
0,"Whenever they are allowed to take a walk outside their cells, take a bath or go to the toilet, their hands are still tied, and they are supervised on the two sides by two US soldiers."
1,It may even want to seek revenge and use them to reassert its authority.
1,"Now that these prisoners are in its hands, it is not likely that the US Government will let them off easily."
0,"These detainees are instructed not to look around, not to talk, not to listen, and not to touch anything."
0,One military tribunal will try these prisoners.
1,"The exercise should include sports, games and outdoor activities."
0,"There will not be a jury, and these captives may not appeal."
0,What followed was the Afghanistan war.
1,Apparently the international community does not support the US viewpoint and measures.
1,"While the international community does not have any universally acknowledged definition for ""terrorist,"" there is also not any established provision in international law for assessing the punishments for ""terrorists."" In particular, there is not any precedence to be used as reference."
1,"The international community, however, has different descriptions and views on this issue."
0,"They are not allowed to look around, talk, hear, or touch anything; nor are they allowed to move freely."
1,"After winning the war, the US Government has come up with many other excuses to deny the captives' POW status."
1,"US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said that the Afghanistan\'s Taliban and ""al-Qaeda"" members are ""unlawful combatants,"" not ""POWs,"" and so the United States would not treat them as POWs and they would not enjoy any rights prescribed in the Geneva Convention on POWs."
0,"The menu also includes oatmeal, raisin, potato chips and a pretzel."
0,The convention has specified the treatment for POWs and their privileges.
1,The Convention's provisions are: \n\t\n\t\n POWs shall be protected under all circumstances.
1,This is the crux of the issue.
1,"Taking these factors into consideration, Powell, a soldier-turned statesman and a moderate, advised Bush: We might as well give the Guantanamo detainees the POW status."
0,Fully-armed watchful US prison guards and naval personnel make the rounds of inspection in the camp.
1,"What appears does not seem to be what the United States wants, however."
1,"Before the war, the United States appeared as an upholder of justice; while it still wants to handle problems like an upholder of justice after the war, it must win support."
0,"The pictures clearly show that the prisoners in orange one-piece overall are blind-folded by thick black cloths, their hands and feet are tied up, and they were kneeling on the ground."
1,"The core issue is whether the Taliban and al-Qaeda members are ""POWs"" or ""unlawful combatants."" \n\t\n\t\n Avna Kidlon [name as transliterated], senior policy advisor to Amnesty International, said: ""The status of the detainees is an issue concerning their life or death."
1,"Under the request of organizations, such as the International Red Cross, and the media, the United States let them go to Guantanamo to inspect the situation of the detainees there."
1,"One thing the international community feels incomprehensible is that why are these Taliban and ""al-Qaeda"" members not considered as POWs since, before the war they were organized combatants, the battles they fought were also organized resistance, and they were obviously captured in battles during the war?"
1,"While these foods are strange to the prisoners, the United States has indeed abided by the dietary rules that Muslims have to follow."
0,Each Side Has a Different Story with Respect to the Treatment for POWs
0,The prisoners' hands and feet are shackled.
1,"Without a doubt, the United States\' ""willfulness"" is what has greatly annoyed some countries and international organizations."
1,"However, respect for human and their rights is an expression of mankind's progress, and the United States always underscores these values and ideas."
1,POWs shall have the opportunity to exercise.
0,"The prisoners, dressed in orange one-piece overall, are hand-cuffed."
1,"If similar problems occur in the future, other countries will have no universally-acknowledged rules to follow."
0,This little cell will house two or more prisoners with the arrival of more captives in the future.
0,The United States is one of the signatories.
1,"Before the war, US President Bush, in his war mobilization speech, declared that the country was in a state of war."
1,"Clothing, underwear, and footwear shall be supplied to POWs in sufficient quantity by the Detaining Power; and they must be adequate for ensuring POWs' health."
0,"Promulgated in 12 August 1949, the Geneva POW Convention became effective on 21 October 1950."
1,"Thus, the United States cannot simply consider this issue as ""contradiction between the enemy and itself,"" it must also consider international relations."
1,"Thus, the prisoners' living conditions in that day were basically transparent."
1,"If it chooses to characterize these detainees as POWs, then it must release some of them sooner or later and it is very likely that these people will again attack the United States with terrorist means."
1,But people still question why the US Government refuses to characterize the detainees in Guantanamo as prisoners of war while claiming that the treatment for them is in line with the Geneva Convention on POWs.
1,The current treatment for the detainees: \n\t\n\t\n The prisoners were brought to the prisons in a brutal manner.
1,Housing conditions for POWs should be the same as those of the troops stationing in the Detaining Power in the same area.
1,"If the United States chooses to disregard the Geneva Convention the way it follows this time, the legality and sanctity of international law will be substantially reduced."
1,"In short, they are not allowed to move freely."
1,"What worries the West and some other countries most is that, if the United States refuses to treat these detainees as POWs, then their soldiers may be treated the same way as the Guantanamo prisoners should they be captured by the Taliban remnants and other radical organizations when they take part in the United Nations' peace-keeping missions."
1,The use of tobacco shall be permitted.
0,There are watchtowers at its four corners.
1,"Now let us compare the convention's provisions and the media's descriptions of the detainees in terms of their dignity, lodging, clothing, activities and trial."
1,"Basing on the media reports, the US Government has many things to consider on this issue."
1,"There should be a jury, and they are entitled to appeal."
1,Reprisal against the prisoners of war shall be prohibited.
1,A medium has this description for the Guantanamo prisoners' camp: The 2.5-square meter cement cell is way below the standards of cells built for American prisoners.
1,"Therefore, on the issue of defining these prisoners\' ""status,"" the United States must test the attitudes of the international community, especially the attitudes of European countries."
0,"When the prisoners are let out for exercise, take a bath, or go to the toilet, their hands must still be tied up, and two US soldiers will accompany them."
0,"One US military officer in charge of the prisoners' camp said that the most of the prisoners are young people in their 20s or 30s, and that they are locked up separately in cells 2.5 square meters each."
1,"They say that these captives not only receive humanitarian treatment, their religious belief is also respected."
1,Their movements are quite confined.

0,"He said the US Armed Forces have given each prisoner living necessities, such as towel, toothpaste, soap, and shampoo; and each prisoner has a twin bed with soft mattress to sleep."
1,"These prisoners not only are citizens of the belligerent country, but also are citizens of nonbelligerent countries, even citizens of the United States' allies, such as Britain."
1,"Moreover, the Taliban and ""al-Qaeda"" members came from many countries in the world and the ""POW"" issue involves the laws and dignity of many countries."
1,"Of course, there is clean water for the prisoners to drink."
1,A number of observers believe that the reasons behind America's opposition to Chavez and its support for Venezuela under the generals who carried out the coup against him go back to the domestic and foreign plans and policies of Chavez.
1,They had been thinking about ways of ousting Chavez from the presidential palace in Caracas.
1,America was trying to guarantee the flow of Venezuelan crude oil to itself by overthrowing Chavez and the seizing of power in the Venezuelan presidential palace by the dependent generals.
1,"The elected president of the people of Venezuela, ""Hugo Chavez"" [punctuation as published here and throughout], has once more taken up the reins of power at the presidential palace in Caracas."
1,This is something that the American officials have acknowledged on many occasions.
1,"This is while before Chavez, Venezuela used to be called the ""errant member"" within OPEC, a member that would follow less the concerted decisions of OPEC and observe less its own quotas."
1,"America called the action of several military generals, who were supported by capitalist as well as bankers, as the victory of democracy in Venezuela under circumstances where Hugo Chavez had come to power in 1988 through a popular process."
1,"He also accused America of killing innocent children and people during the Afghan war, met with ""Mo\'ammar Qadhafi"" and ""Saddam Hoseyn"", the presidents of Libya and Iraq and long-term enemies of Washington, and had a very close relationship with the Cuban leader ""Fidel Castro""."
1,"Ever since he came to power, Chavez had refused to accept America's biding and had called on Washington on numerous occasions to stop intervening in his country."
1,The Bush administration's support for the Venezuelan putschists is testament to this.
1,"What is more, the promoting of a constitutional reform plan and carrying out of extensive economic reforms have led to his re-election in July 2000 as the president of Venezuela for a further six year term."
1,"That is to say, he adopted positions where supply of oil by OPEC would be reduced and oil prices supported."
1,The combination of Chavez's performance and policies brought on the wrath of American President Bush to the extent that he failed to hide his anger during his visit to Peru.
1,"Moreover, in its posturing with respect to this country, America declared that democracy had been victorious in Venezuela."
1,"Besides these instances of American hostility towards Chavez, mention must be made of his oil policy within OPEC."
1,"Following a series of domestic reforms, especially in the agriculture, energy and banking sectors and describing communism and capitalism as futile, Chavez caused the business leaders, bankers and capitalist to distance themselves from him and thus paved the way for their opposition to his power."
1,"This is why one cannot dismiss the effects of the intensification of the Middle East crisis, Iraq's initiative in using crude oil as a political weapon against Washington and the debate on an extensive oil embargo against the supporters of Israel on the events of the past few days in Venezuela as well as America's support for the putschists there."
1,He has managed to a great extent to adopt policies aligned with other oil producing states whenever oil crises have emerged that led to reduced oil prices in the market.
1,"Finally, America prescribes liberal democracy for others yet fails itself to accord any value to democratic principles in the world."
1,The new laws were described by leaders of the economy as deviant and unfair and these leaders organised and stage-managed street demonstrations against Chavez with the help of the biggest trade and commercial unions as well as a sector of the army.
1,"The rapid events and the changing of power in Venezuela indicate that the putschists did not enjoy a popular base and the Venezuelan people as well as the military in the country did not endorse the coup government of ""Pedro Carmona"" who was being supported by America."
1,America was the only country that came to the support of the putschists immediately after they took power in Venezuela.
1,"Powell had stressed that Venezuela is able to, as in the past, that is to say, the era of the military rule in that country, play an effective role in America's policies in Latin America."
1,"Outside the borders of Venezuela, Chavez faced America's hostility."
1,"Moreover, the American Secretary of State ""Powell"" also has recently announced in his annual report to the American Congress that taking into account Hugo Chavez\'s closeness to countries that are not dependent on America, he is not considered to be a trustworthy pawn in the Latin American region."
1,"In recent years, Chavez caused OPEC oil policies to be strengthened in the face of the positions adopted by oil consumers."
1,The people of Venezuela thwarted America in this.
1,"During his meetings with Peruvian officials, Bush spoke of America's dislike of Chavez."
0,"In the Gaza Strip 1,051 donums were annexed to existing settlements, 32 new housing units were built, and work on 190 additional units was started."
1,The report also noted that work on bypass roads continued at a rate faster than that of the government of Barak who gave free rein to settlement activities.
0,Construction activities carried out in settlements during the period totaled 49.
1,"The second is Israel\'s enacting of laws that facilitate expropriating Palestinian land and settlement activity, a matter that is considered among the war crimes."""
1,"He explained that Palestinian population centers were used as human shields for the protection of settlements, and that about 90 percent of the bombardments to which Palestinian population centers were subjected originated in settlements."
1,"Advocate Faris Abu-Hasan pointed to the violation of international laws represented in settlement activity and settlement building, and to Israel's continuing refusal to respond to international appeals and violation of relevant international laws."
1,"He confirmed that 30 Palestinians were martyred at the hands of settlers, 60 persons were hit by settlers' bullets, while more than 77 others were injured in various assaults by settlers."
0,"Taysir Khalid, member of the PLO Executive Committee and of the political bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, advocate Faris Abu-Hasan from the Solidarity Establishment, and Hasan Ayyub, director of the National Bureau for Defense of Land, took part in the conference."
1,"He pointed to the allocations in the Sharon Government's budget for supporting and widening settlements and building new ones, despite the crisis and recession from which Israel's economy suffers."
1,"He noted that during the current intifadah settlers uprooted more than 6,580 fruit trees, destroyed more than 4,099 cultivated donums, while 85 houses, 90 commercial premises, more than 100 cars, and 17 ambulances were damaged as a result of attacks carried out by settlers."
1,"He explained that settlement building constituted two grave violations of international law, especially the Geneva Convention, and pointed to international law provisions that forbid moving population of the occupying state to the occupied territories."
1,He explained that an Israeli court recently sentenced a Palestinian member of a group accused of opening fire in which no one was hurt to seven years imprisonment.
1,"He referred to the legal cover and protection settlers enjoy, and the encouragement this gives them to continue their aggressions."
1,"He noted that the year since Sharon became Israel Prime Minister and his pursuit of a destructive, aggressive policy against the Palestinian people has ""proved that the conflict with the Palestinian people who cling to their national rights cannot be settled by force."""
1,"Sharon's government has embarked on building 10 bypass roads, some of which were approved by the previous government."
1,He explained that the intifadah has proved that the settlement battle is not over.
0,"And 1,857 donums were bulldozed during the building of bypass roads in the strip."
1,The report highlighted the damage caused to the agricultural sector as a result of settlement activity.
0,The annual report published by the National Bureau for Defending Land and Resisting Colonization in cooperation with the International Solidarity Establishment for Human Rights said that the nuclei of 36 new settlements were established from March 2001 to the end of November 2001 in various parts of the West Bank.
0,The total losses of the agricultural sector amounted to $432 million according to Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture data.
1,"He said: ""There are two grave violations, the first concerns settlement building and the transfer of settlers to the Palestinian territories on which tens of settlements have been built."
1,"In addition, 102 mobile caravans were added to settlements and new settlement sites and more than 705 donums were added to existing settlements."
1,While a settler who opened fire on a group of Palestinians wounding four of them was sentenced to four years imprisonment by an Israeli court.
1,"He stressed that since the outbreak of the intifadah in 1987, 18 percent of all Palestinians martyred were killed by settlers."
1,"He surveyed the attacks against unarmed citizens carried out by settlers, the legal protection and backing they are provided by Israeli governments, and the encouragement that this gives them to continue their assaults."
1,He pointed out that there is an alternation of roles between settlers and the army in carrying out aggressions against Palestinians and terrorizing them.
1,"The report estimated that building these roads threatens the bulldozing and destruction of more than 31,730 donums."
1,"He stressed the need to concentrate on resisting settlement activity, settlers and their militias, and abstaining from subjecting this file to any discussion as a condition for halting the intensified settlement activities and removing existing settlements."
1,It also noted that settlers and the occupation authorities pursue a comprehensive destructive policy on a wide scale vis-a-vis citizens' property to consolidate facts and settlement plans drawn up by the occupation government.
1,He indicated that settlements have emerged as military bastions and bases for launching attacks against Palestinians during the intifadah.
0,A report about settlement activity in Palestinian territories has confirmed that 36 new settlement sites--settlement enclaves--have been created since Sharon became Prime Minister of Israel less than a year ago.
0,"It said that about 487,093 fruit trees were uprooted during the second half of last year and 32,000 donums of agricultural land were bulldozed."
0,"Also the report, whose findings were announced at a press conference yesterday, noted that three military positions were turned into civilian settlements and work had started on a new settlement called Giv'at Sal'it in the southern valleys region."
1,"He said: ""At a time when Israel\'s economic growth rate declined to 1.5 percent and the budgets of the Ministry of Labor and Welfare and other ministries were cut, Sharon\'s government maintained its support for settlements and increased it to compensate for the growing exodus from settlements."""
1,"Taysir Khalid explained that ""the Palestinian intifadah has raised the settlement issue anew--one of the causes of the intifadah--in unprecedented force as a basic element and condition for reaching any solution."""
1,"The ""three liters for 100 kilometers"" car, high efficiency turbines, and solar panels are export successes and their development is driven by a climate protection policy of growing amplitude."
1,"The United States, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (25 percent of global emissions) withdrew from an international agreement that, for the first time, set binding targets for developed countries for climate protection."
1,Recent weeks have seen important developments on both sides of the Atlantic for the policy pursued in combating climate change.
1,Anybody who fails to exploit these markets from the outset will remain lagging behind.
1,Scientists estimate that the industrialized countries must reduce their emissions to around 70 percent by 2020 to maintain climate change at an acceptable level.
1,"It should be remembered that after Bush described the Kyoto Protocol as ""fundamentally flawed"" international negotiations on climate protection almost collapsed."
1,"In addition, if the US economy continues to grow, the increased energy efficiency will be cancelled out or more than cancelled out."
1,"In Europe, the council of environment ministers concluded a formal political agreement on 4 March on the decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before 1 June this year."
1,"Unfortunately, the recent US climate protection program falls far short of meeting such expectations."
0,Demand for these technologies is increasing worldwide.
0,"Under the US program, US emissions as a proportion of GDP must fall by 18 percent between 2002 and 2012, or in other words energy efficiency must increase by 18 percent."
1,"The European Union played a dominant role in these negotiations and the community of states concluded, at the Bonn and Marrakech conferences of July and October last year, an agreement that sets out how to implement the Kyoto Protocol and provides for an original mechanism for respecting the reduction obligations that could possibly serve as a model for other agreements and that suggests a possible strengthening of international institutional structures in the environmental field."
1,Even today it is difficult to find buyers outside the United States for the fuel-guzzling cars of the US automobile industry.
0,"In the United States, on 14 February President Bush presented the US national climate protection program."
1,The dominant role of the European climate protection policy has benefits for our economy.
1,US reticence is not therefore a reason for us to reduce our climate protection efforts.
1,The return of the United States to the system must remain our goal.
1,"However, all the parties repeated with insistence that world climate protection cannot be effective unless the United States takes measures that are comparable to these taken by Europe and Japan."
1,"With this major decision, the European Union is opening the door to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol for climate protection just in time for the world summit on sustainable development to be held in August 2002 in Johannesburg."
1,"With an annual economic growth objective of 3 percent, absolute US emissions in 2012 will be 24.5 percent more than 1990 levels, despite the improvement in energy efficiency."
1,It should therefore be implemented as quickly as possible and extended beyond the initial period of 2008-2012.
1,"On the contrary, it can have a positive effect."
1,This can hardly be described as ambitious as a 15 percent increase in energy efficiency was in any event expected given present productivity levels.
1,"Although there is a certain satisfaction at seeing President Bush recognize the need to fight climate change, that must not in any way conceal the extreme weakness of what he announced."
1,We hope that the United States will come to realize that an active climate protection policy is not only necessary for environmental policy but is also an excellent opportunity to modernize industrial society.
1,"By comparison, respect for the Kyoto Protocol requires the EU to reduce its emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990, Japan by 6 percent, and the United States by 7 percent, a figure accepted by President Clinton in 1997."
1,"If the effects of climate change were not so devastating and our action were to be guided by economic competition, we Europeans could welcome the fact that the United States is not committing itself to an ambitious climate protection program, in so far as the technologies in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy are the technologies of the future."
1,"In its last report, the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] called for rapid and decisive action to at least avert the most serious consequences of climate change."
1,Researchers have shown that without a determined policy on climate coordinated at international level the consequences of climate change will be dramatic.
1,This must now be ratified by all the parties and will shortly enter into force.
1,"The average global temperature will increase by 5.8d C by 2100, sea levels will rise by up to 90 cm over the same period, and there will be an increasing number of hurricanes with ever more serious consequences, while man and nature will have to cope with a shift in climate and rainfall zones the like of which has never been seen before."
1,The warnings by climate experts went unheeded in the US climate protection program.
1,Many studies show that an active policy of climate protection is not in any way contrary to a policy of full employment.
1,The Kyoto Protocol is a first major step.
1,"At our instigation, on 4 March EU environment ministers therefore called on the United States to ""assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement on climate change,"" that is to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels and strengthen domestic actions to bring them into line with the level of effort accepted by the industrial countries in application of the Kyoto Protocol."
1,By implementing our European and national climate protection programs we will succeed in creating several hundred thousand new jobs by 2010.
1,We now know that the US withdrawal did not stop the world community from deepening this important multilateral agreement for combating climate change.
1,The door remains wide open for the United States to return to the Kyoto process: The biggest emitter of greenhouse gases cannot be relieved of its responsibilities for global climate protection.
0,Question: Will the United States sell Aegis destroyers to Taiwan?
1,"If Taiwan becomes a part of China, all of Taiwan's sea areas will be threatened."
0,Sato: I gave a speech on this issue in Taiwan.
1,"If warheads with biological weapons are used, China has no means to justify this to international public opinion."
0,"Recently, old Yugoslavia fired 3,000 missiles at Kosovo and Kosovo also did not surrender."
1,"Taiwan is also very important to the United States, especially Taiwan's strategic position."
1,"Although Japan and the United States haven't recognized it, in reality, the United States, Japan and Taiwan currently are already situated in a kind of virtual alliance."
1,"Taiwan announcing independence is not itself a problem, but because Taiwan announcing independence would bring unrest and a domino effect would occur with regard to Tibet and Xinjiang, this is China's greatest fear."
0,Question: How should Taiwan respond to China's missile threat?
1,Stable ocean traffic is an absolute necessity.
1,"It is not possible that the Republican Party will get along with China, Taiwan can again wait for a little while."
1,This is an issue of will.
0,China is currently in the process of actively expanding as a maritime nation.
1,The PC-3's intelligence exchange system is extremely important and is not inferior to the Aegis destroyer.
1,"Not using peaceful methods to resolve the Taiwan issue won't do, and I reckon that the US-Japan summit talks will discuss the issue of the two shores."
1,"Anti-submarine combat strength is extremely low, and in particular there are many old style naval aircraft that, compared to Japan, are possibly 30 to 40 years behind."
1,The Navy's problems are very large.
1,"In 1996, the Chinese People's Liberation Army indeed fired four missiles near Taiwan, but this was a kind of propaganda war."
1,"However, Taiwan announcing independence to the outside world is a variable."
0,"During the Second World War, Germany fired 7,000 V1 and V2 missiles at England and England did not surrender."
0,Half of this one third was transported to Japan through the sea areas near Taiwan.
1,"Under these circumstances, Taiwan and Japan both must recognize clearly the important role of the navy."
1,"However, China is not a nation that is able to abide by international rules, and for this reason, there will inevitably be conflicts on the ocean."
1,"Kawamura: One of the reasons that the United States has all along not provided Aegis destroyers to Taiwan is that in the past the United States considered Taiwan's armed forces to be the armed forces of the Nationalist Party, not the armed forces of the nation."
1,Taiwan has some people who very obviously purposely play up China's use of force to scare Taiwan.
1,"If China only uses common warheads, at most, it would only make a few holes in Taiwan."
0,"Before President Bush visits China, Japanese naval strategy expert Kawamura Sumihiko and missile expert Sato Mamoru were exclusively interviewed by a reporter of this newspaper."
0,"US President Bush, after visiting Japan and South Korea, will follow with a visit to China."
0,"Currently, Taiwan's Patriot missiles are effective against guided missiles."
1,There would be no difference between Taiwan announcing independence to the outside world and the current situation.
1,The traffic on Taiwan's seas is extremely important to Japan.
1,"For example, there is only one submarine attached to each naval base."
0,Question: What is the significance for Taiwan of the United States and Japan jointly researching TMD theater missile defense system technology?
1,Question: Where is China's true threat to Taiwan
0,"Last year, approximately 5.1 billion tons of goods passed through the world's oceans, about one third of which passed through the sea areas of southern China."
1,"Kawamura: Frankly speaking, Taiwan's navy is worrisome."
1,Taiwan should make an all out effort to augment naval combat strength.
1,Torpedo strength is also insufficient.
1,Nationalization of the armed forces after Lee Teng-hui (Li Teng-hui) and the loyal attitude of the armed forces after Chen Shui-bian (Ch'en Shui-pien) came into office have already gradually allowed the United States to feel at ease.
1,"Whether Bush will, like Clinton, damage Taiwan's interests is receiving the deep concern of all quarters."
0,Question: What is your appraisal of Taiwan's navy?
1,The possibility of the TMD anti-missile system covering Taiwan in the future is very great.
1,They reiterated the importance of Taiwan's strategic position and at the same time put forward their views with regard to the situation in the Taiwan Strait.
1,The protection of Taiwan's interests under the US-Japan alliance structure is fairly strong.
1,"In past Taiwan-US arms sale negotiations, the PC-3 early warning aircraft and the MH53 helicopter that Taiwan has made requests to purchase are entirely suitable to Taiwan's needs."
0,"Sato: China's threat to Taiwan is the use of the three methods of missiles, amphibious landing, and submarine blockades."
1,"I reckon that at the last stage, the United States will provide the Aegis destroyer to Taiwan."
1,"Taiwan has no need to announce independence, and there won\'t be any problem if only the name ""Taiwan"" is used."
1,It can only be said that this is nothing more than an embellishment and fundamentally cannot accomplish anything.
1,The most likely method is to use missiles to threaten Taiwan psychologically.
1,Its purpose is to ensure resources and the lives of a population of 1.5 billion people.
0,Kawamura: Japan and Taiwan are both exporting nations.
1,"Sato: After the 9-11 incident, the United States will be even keener on developing TMD."
1,I reckon that the probability of war occurring between China and Taiwan is smaller than small.
1,"Before the United States attacked Afghanistan, it first explained the reasons to every nation of the world, and China using missiles to attack Taiwan is certainly not simple."
1,"""The Taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive issue at the core of Sino-US relations,"" she said at the biweekly ministry briefing."
1,"China has considered Taiwan a renegade province since 1949 and has threatened to bring it back by force if it continues to indefinitely refuse proposals for ""peaceful reunification."""
1,"She refused to confirm an April 26 to May 3 visit by Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao to Washington, as reported in the Hong Kong press."
1,US officials denied Wolfowitz's remarks reflected a change in US policy on Taiwan.

1,"""We don\'t support Taiwan independence, but we oppose the use of force."""
1,"BEIJING, April 11 (AFP) - China on Thursday slammed increasingly close ties between the United States and Taiwan, demanding an end to official exchanges between the two and to US weapons sales."
1,"Zhang said: ""The remarks of the US official are a ... violation of US commitments made (on Taiwan) and interference in China internal affairs."
1,"Military tensions in the Taiwan Strait were ""not in the self-interests of the United States,"" she warned."
1,"The visit, if Beijing allows it, is widely expected to be centered on China's dissatisfaction over the Taiwan issue."
1,"""The continual sale of arms by the United States or upgrading of relations with Taiwan will only lead to tensions across the straits,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said."
1,"""We demand the US strictly abide by the commitments it has made to China, correct its erroneous acts or remarks so as to avoid new harm to China-US relations."""
1,Zhang further expressed alarm over Washington's announcement Wednesday that defense department officials will soon visit Taiwan to discuss the sale of eight diesel electric submarines.
1,"""China has always resolutely opposed any form of official exchanges or military intercourse between the United States and Taiwan,"" Zhang said."
1,"Zhang also bashed remarks made last month by US Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz at a meeting in Florida, attended by visiting Taiwanese Defense Minister Tang Yao-Ming."
1,"Beijing has also long refused to establish diplomatic relations with any nation that maintains official contact with Taiwan, although it has encouraged economic exchanges between Taiwan and all nations."
0,Chinese missile tests over Taiwan in 1996 resulted in Washington deploying two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region.
1,"China is firmly opposed to the remarks."""
1,"""The United States is committed to doing whatever it takes to help Taiwan defend itself,"" said Wolfowitz, echoing President George W. Bush\'s remarks made when he first took office last year."

0,The possibility of cooperating with other countries' early quota systems.
0,"Between now and 2008, the government's environmental initiative will be given concrete form in a report to the Storting this spring, in which an early quota system will occupy a central place."
1,The explanation is that the increased concentration of climate gases in the atmosphere and the slowness of the climate system will make a certain degree of global warming unavoidable.
1,"According to the United Nations' climate panel, in the next 10 to 20 years changes in the climate will be almost unaffected by what we do in the way of initiatives in the next few years to reduce emissions of climate gases."
1,"Even if developing countries have contributed to these climate problems to just a slight degree, they will nevertheless bear the greatest burden."
1,The consensus that has been achieved internationally about the period 2008-2012 is just the first step down the road.
1,"But if we do not make these expenditures now, the bill for the generations to come will be even bigger."
1,Norway should be in the forefront of combating climate problems.

1,"For later periods, sharper reductions are necessary and there is also the need to get more countries to take on climate obligations."
0,The climate changes will be different from region to region.
1,The use of quotas will be a cost-effective means of achieving better results.
0,North Norway will also get more precipitation in the fall but warmer temperatures in the winter.

0,Implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
0,"In recent years the RegClim research project, under the aegis of the Norwegian Research Council, has worked to estimate the way the climate will develop in Norway in 30 to 50 years."
1,"Regardless of the shape of the measures in Norway, Norwegian businesses as well ought to contribute to reducing emissions in poor countries."
1,This gives us a special responsibility in climate policy-not least vis-a-vis the poorest countries.
1,A proposal for an early quota system will be at the center of this report.
1,"There is consensus that a broad quota system with international quota exchange should be used to achieve our emission responsibilities during the first obligatory period, 2008-2012."
0,Norway is one of the countries in this world that has earned the most from fossil fuels.
1,How should we prepare ourselves for more and bigger floods?
0,A quota is a right to emit a certain quantity of climate gases during a certain period and this right can be sold on a market.
0,"This mechanism can already be used-and before 2008, too."
1,"The government's policy statement states, among other things, that the establishment of a national quota system should be speeded up."
1,The main conclusions were that the trend toward warmer weather and more precipitation will presumably continue.
0,"In the government's work to put the quota system into shape in Norway, we are now discussing a number of problems."
0,"In addition to producing climate benefits, such measures will contribute to development and reduced local pollution in poor countries."
1,I am pleased that there now seems to be broad political consensus that in Norway as well we should get under way with an early quota system.
1,What consequences will the increase in temperature have for raising livestock and fish?
1,The elements in a more offensive climate policy are: \n\t\n\t\n Initiatives between now and 2008: The government wants to show demonstrable progress in the reduction of climate emissions by 2005.
0,The report to the Storting that the government is preparing for the spring will further specify which measures will be implemented between now and 2008.
1,These extrapolations of the state of the climate are not completely reliable.
1,There exists the potential for significant reductions in climate gas emissions in Norway that will not produced with today's resources.
1,Norway still wants to play an active role in this process.
1,In the Sem statement the coalition government warned of a more offensive climate policy.
0,The advantages are that the authorities can set a ceiling on all emissions.
1,"Regardless of what Norway and other countries manage to do in this respect, we must prepare ourselves for climate changes."
0,Businesses that are obligated by a quota can then choose whether they want to buy those quotas they need or introduce measures to reduce emissions.
1,The challenge will be to introduce the most cost-effective climate policy possible and at the same time take Norwegian business and industry's competitiveness into consideration.
0,In the eastern part of Norway the biggest increase in precipitation will be in the winter.
1,"In addition to being effective, an early quota system would also give business and industry useful experience before the international quota system following the Kyoto Protocol comes into effect in 2008."
1,The government wants to set the stage for Norway to ratify the Kyoto Protocol next year.
0,"Some of these are: \n\t\n\t\n The range-which gases and sectors should be included in the quota system, and how businesses exposed to competition should be dealt with."
1,Will climate changes produce new types of pests that will create problems?
0,Fines for exceeding the quota limit.
1,"Even if we can say with great certainty that climate changes will come, we need more knowledge about the effects ."
1,We must avoid seeing environmental problems increase the social differences in the world.
0,In coming years the winters will be less snowy but greener and wetter.
0,The western part of Norway will experience the markedly greatest increase in precipition in the fall.
1,For the next few years our goal is to both gain more knowledge and put together good preparedness strategies.
1,"Norway and other industrialized countries, on the other hand, have fairly good prospects of grappling with climate changes because we have an economy to put necessary measures to work."
1,This our conscience ought not to permit us.
1,Norway and the other rich countries have a moral responsibility to achieve real reductions.
1,The government wants to play an active role internationally but we should also work on reducing emissions here at home.

1,"By supporting Sharon's irresponsible saber rattling, Washington places strains on its relations with the Arab countries and needlessly puts off a settlement, in which it must some day play the role of midwife."
1,"Sharon, of course, will not admit that he is planning anything like this, even though the idea has been discussed in Israel."
0,The first would involve continuous occupation and [the development of] an apartheid state similar to South Africa.
1,Israeli's own 35-year-old occupation and resettlement policies have created the breeding ground for the terrorism that Sharon is now trying to root out by resorting exclusively to military means.
1,One would think that no politically prudent Israeli could support either of them.
1,"Nevertheless, in his subsequent remarks, Bush encouraged Sharon to continue."
1,"The last few months have demonstrated that, on the contrary, they have become an extraordinary burden."
0,They are the simultaneous ending of the violence and the [Israeli] resettlement policy followed by negotiations on the basis of the recent Saudi Arabian proposal and the earlier results of the talks at Camp David and Taba.
0,The high birthrate of the Palestinian population guarantees that it will not be possible to change the population balance of the occupied territories by stepping up resettlement [by the Jewish population].
1,"The desperate tableau that has emerged in the last few days is becoming even more dismal, and the administration of President George W. Bush does not appear to have any sort of logical Near East policy."
1,Israel is responsible for about three million bitter people who lack political rights.
0,Traffic to the settlements prevents the effective monitoring of Israel's borders.
1,The only means of preventing a return to terrorism would be [to launch] a counter-terrorist effort that extends to every village.
1,"A few kilograms of explosives, a simple detonating fuse, and a desperate hatred are the most important ingredients."
1,As Israeli tanks push their way into one Palestinian population center after another it has become more and more difficult to guess what political objectives might be driving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
1,The ingredients for a decision are in large measure in place if they would only be admitted by the two sides.
1,Israel's resettlement policies have been justified on the grounds of security.
1,"Terrorism will not be absent from such a country and, in the process, Israel will lose the right to count itself among the world's democracies."
1,"In the United Nations, it supported [a call for] the removal of Israeli troops from the cities in the occupied areas."
1,"Even if, contrary to all reason, the operation turns out to be successful, the underlying problem would remain the same as before."
1,This would soon erode both what is left of the army's reputation and its military cutting edge.
1,"We can understand this as an immediate military objective, but nothing will be achieved by the operation politically."
1,"Since Sharon refuses to offer the Palestinians their own state with acceptable borders and conditions, there are two alternatives left."
1,"The categorical moral condemnation of terrorism is self-evident, but this will not free Israel from the problem it faces."
1,It is high time for the United States to hurry to offer its assistance.
1,"He says he wants to destroy the ""infrastructure"" behind the suicide attacks against the Israelis."
1,The Prime Minister should explain once and for all what third objective he might have for his actions.
1,"The EU will continue on its current path of emission reduction and is optimistic that other major players, notably Japan and Russia, will join us in these efforts."
1,"Furthermore, a review of the effectiveness of the measures will not take place before 2012."
1,It is clear that the proposals for US action on climate change are domestic.
1,The EU is of the opinion that a cap-and-trade system is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions which combines a guaranteed environmental result with the flexibility to reduce emissions where it is least costly.
0,Current emission projections for the US indicate an increase of 39% above 1990 levels in 2012.
0,This is the ultimate objective of the Convention to which the US has subscribed.
1,Achieving this would only be a first step towards stabilising global greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous climate change.
1,But the EU is concerned that they will not even be sufficient to reduce US emissions.
1,"However, mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions at company level would be necessary to adequately assess whether the proposals by President Bush represent an effort comparable to the ones under the Kyoto Protocol."
1,"The proposals by President Bush may represent a first step in the right direction, where also economic operators in the US are asked to contribute to emission control."
0,"The Climate Change Convention of 1992, to which the US is a Party, requires industrialised countries to stabilise their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels."
1,The EU welcomes the fact that the Bush administration has now completed its policy review and has put forward what the US intends to do in terms of domestic climate change policy.
1,"However, the new plan does not lead to such a stabilisation, but instead will lead to the increase of absolute emission levels."
0,"Over the past years, greenhouse gas emissions intensity in relation to GDP has been falling in the US."
1,"On the contrary, the Kyoto Protocol requires most industrialised countries to achieve absolute emission reductions, while they still foresee to have growing economies."
1,"The ""intensity target"" proposed allows for further increases in absolute emissions and is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change."
1,The EU is concerned about the purely voluntary nature of the actions proposed.
1,"By 2005, the EU intends to implement a cap-and-trade system covering 46% of all CO2 emissions in 2010."
1,"While the intensity improvements may reduce this to around 33%, this is still a very substantial increase in absolute emissions."
1,The EU will further examine and assess the proposals by President Bush in the weeks to come and is willing to continue the dialogue with the US on this basis.
1,The EU is determined to proceed with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 in view of entry into force by the time of the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
1,"The Bush plan is based on a prolongation of this trend thereby in effect foreseeing little more than continuation on a ""business-as-usual"" path."
1,"It is striking that the approach which is considered beneficial for other air pollutants, namely to implement cap-and-trade programmes, is not extended to CO2 emissions from the power sector."
1,"French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine criticized the remark as ""simplistic interpretation of the world."""
1,"However, Koizumi said, ""I take the remark as the indication of the President\'s strong resolve to fight terrorism."""
0,"At a meeting of several officials held at the outset of the summit, the President first took up economic issues and then referred to his ""axis of evil"" remark."
1,"""It is also politically very difficult"" to enact a new law considering the declining support for the Koizumi Cabinet, said a source within the Prime Minister\'s Official Residence."
1,"European countries are critical of Bush\'s ""axis of evil"" remark."
1,"He urged Japan to follow the US by saying: ""The international community needs to cooperate to change Iran, Iraq, and North Korea\'s action pattern (of spreading weapons of mass destruction)."
1,"However, it will be difficult for Japan to provide support to the US, as it did when the US attacked Afghanistan, if US forces launch military action against Iraq."
1,"Although the Japanese Government has expressed understanding of Bush's axis of evil remark, it does not hope to see the US taking military action."
1,"This left the impression that Japan stands alone on this issue because European countries have been cool to Bush\'s ""axis of evil"" rhetoric."
0,"All options (including military action) are on the table."""
1,"However, it will be difficult for the Self-Defense Forces to provide logistic support to US forces attacking Iraq under a special antiterrorism law aimed at eradicating terrorism, which was enacted after terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September."
1,"If Japan does not give any support to possible US attacks on Iraq despite its understanding of the axis of evil rhetoric, Bush's expectations on the Koizumi administration will certainly change to disappointment."
1,The US has repeatedly suggested the possibility of its taking military action against the government of Iraqi President Saddam Husayn.
1,"At a Japan-US summit meeting on 18 February, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi expressed some understanding of US President George W. Bush\'s remarks that Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK (North Korea) are an ""axis of evil."""
1,"Because of this, Koizumi noted the need for the international community to cooperate in tackling Iraqi issues and enthusiastically asked Bush to not take the bold course of launching military action."
1,It can be said that the Japanese Government has put itself in a difficult position.
1,"It is possible that if the US military attack Iraq, Japan, which has shown understanding of the axis of evil remark, will be asked to provide active support to the US as it did during US attacks on Afghanistan."
1,"In reply, the President said, ""We want to resolve all issues peacefully, and we intend to continue diplomatic efforts."" However, it is unclear whether Japan can actually prevent the US from taking military action."
1,The long- standing ties Bush and several of his leading advisors have with these companies allow us to suppose an ultimate conflict of interests that would only increase with the government's persistent alignment with their goals.
1,"The Enron scandal is already taking a significant political toll of the Bush team, which will tend to increase."
0,"It is this index that will be reduced, according to the White House, by 18 percent over the next 10 years."
1,"But what the US Government does not emphasize is that the natural tendency of the economy is for services to increase their participation in the GDP, and for industrial activities, which are the biggest energy consumers, to diminish."
1,"However, after a brief period of shock, Bush resumed his solitary road, as he clearly demonstrated in his State of the Union speech, in which he threatened the ""Axis of Evil"" countries (Iran, Iraq, and North Korea) without consulting the Europeans and Japanese, who do not necessarily agree with the appropriateness of antagonizing the governments of those nations."
1,"After the World Trade Center and Pentagon tragedies, there were some who thought that Washington's rapprochement with its traditional partners was inevitable, with the goal of defeating the threat of international terrorism."
1,"The break with Kyoto had been a pre-attack marker in the Bush administration, for having demonstrated the latter's absolute indifference to the opinion of even its closest allies, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan."
1,"Basically, the Bush plan makes the reduction in pollution gas emissions conditional on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate."
1,"Technical arguments could go on an on, and matter little here."
1,"The announcement of a plan that is supposedly an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, but which in practice rejects it in a way that cannot be taken seriously by the countries who committed themselves to it (among which is Brazil), only deserves rejection in response and to provoke in retrospect an enormous concern about what the only world superpower intends in future."
1,"Emissions of these gases should rise at a slower pace than that of the GDP, he says."
0,Some environmental entities calculate that Bush's plan will lead to the US's emitting!
1,"More important are two indisputable conclusions, both potentially embarrassing to the Bush administration and extremely threatening to the world as a whole."
1,"The first is that, once again, the current US administration, faced with a controversial issue, is situating itself alongside the explicit interests of companies in the energy sector."
0,", in 2010, 29 percent more greenhouse gases than it did in 1990."
1,"Therefore, that so-called 18 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could, in fact, represent a real increase in the absolute quantity of such gases."
1,"Seven months after having rejected the Kyoto Protocol because he considered it to be without scientific basis, detrimental to US economic interests, and unfair in not obliging medium-sized nations (like Brazil and India) to reduce their gas emissions in the same proportion as that imposed on industrialized countries, Bush made public the plan that, he promised, would not have any of the defects of the Kyoto Protocol and would achieve the same, if not better, results."
1,United States President George W. Bush finally announced his country's proposal for fighting the greenhouse effect.
1,But the consequences of the divorce between the US and the international community in the Kyoto Protocol case could be even more serious.
1,"The second conclusion is that, contrary to what some optimists were predicting after 11 September, Bush seems to have decided to stick to a course of arrogant unilateralism when conducting his foreign policy."
1,"The first problem pointed out by critics is that Bush has created a new concept, that of ""greenhouse gas intensity,"" which could be defined as the volume of gas emissions divided by GDP."
1,"He emphasized the importance of bilateral cooperation between the two continents in dealing with environmental issues, noting that this meeting will serve as a foundation for Asia and Europe's future cooperation."
1,The Vietnamese Minister called for the establishment of a cooperation forum on the environment which will be held every two years within the Asia-Europe Environment Cooperation Program.
0,He said the Vietnamese Government has mobilized all resources and strengthened its international cooperation in addressing environmental issues.
1,The ASEM EnMM concluded in Beijing on 17 January with the adoption of a Statement of the Presidium calling for an early implementation of the Kyoto Protocol as well as cooperation and dialogue between ASEM members.
1,"Vietnamese Minister of Science, Technology and Environment Chu Tuan Nha told the first Asia-Europe Meeting [ASEM] Environment Ministers' Meeting [ASEM EnMM] in Beijing recently that Vietnam always values environmental protection, including prevention of pollution or degradation, bio-diversity protection, and improvement of the environment in industrial zones and in both urban and rural areas."
0,The forum will facilitate the exchange of dialogues on policy and of information and experts on the environment.
1,"""We hope US behaves as it says, strictly abide by the three Sino-US Communiques and stop using the Taiwan issue to interfere in China\'s internal affairs,"" Zhang said."
1,The spokeswoman urged the US to strictly abide by the serious commitments that it had made to the Chinese government and Chinese people and stop the wrong actions so as to avoid further damage to Sino-US relations.
1,Zhang stressed that history had repeatedly proved that US arms sales to Taiwan and its elevation US-Taiwan relations would only incite the separatists in their attempts to split Taiwan from mainland and would lead to the deterioration of Taiwan Straits situation and boiled down to the jeopardy of the interests of the US itself.
1,"The Taiwan issue was at the core of Sino-US relations, reiterated Zhang, emphasizing that any measures or remarks that ran against the three Sino-US Joint Communiques would undermine Sino-US relations."
1,"The remarks seriously violated the commitments made by the US government in the three Sino-US Joint Communiques, said Zhang, adding that those remarks, out of ulterior motives, interfered in China's internal affairs."
1,"Beijing, April 9 (XINHUA) -- The Taiwan issue is purely China's internal affair and no other country in the world should interfere, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said in response to claims from a high-ranking US military official that the US would do everything needed to protect Taiwan."
1,"Since Japan has no spirit of independence and has always acted on US directions, Japan had continued to put off Diet ratification of the protocol and took such an attitude at the UN session held this time, under the plausible pretext that it would be meaningless to put the ""Kyoto Protocol"" into force, if the United States were excluded."
1,"Of course, behind the Japan's behavior lies its stakes."
1,"Accordingly, Japan would never readily agree on putting the ""Kyoto Protocol"" into force."
1,"At the 1997 conference, representatives of many countries of the world supported and welcomed the adoption of the ""Kyoto Protocol"" as an epoch-making measure to curb the warming of the earth\'s surface and atmosphere."
1,Never doing anything unprofitable is the nature of Japan.
1,"In the midst of this situation, a Japanese official visited the United States and received the instruction that Japan should avoid inordinate behavior with respect to the issue of implementing the ""Kyoto Protocol."""
1,"Here, Japan and other developed countries have to assume especially large responsibilities."
1,"However, as was revealed this time, Japan, which was in a position to take the lead to solve the environmental problems, attempted to back away from solving the problems."
0,"For the ""Kyoto Protocol"" to enter into force, 55 countries have to ratify it."
1,"As is feared by the whole world, preservation of the environment is becoming an awfully grave and pressing problem that is linked to the existence of mankind."
1,"At present, the global warming is a most serious issue, whose gravity is second only to that of a nuclear war."
1,"To do all these things, it needs a tremendous amount of money for investment."
1,"Japan calculated that it would suffer a tremendous loss, if the draft regulations were ever passed intact and would be adopted as a legal document."
1,"In the course of calculating the gains and losses of the ""Kyoto Protocol"" and trying to figure out what it should do, Japan found a good excuse."
1,"Emphasizing the significance of the adoption of the ""Kyoto Protocol,"" Japan loudly trumpeted at that time that the adoption of the protocol was ""produced by the role"" Japan had played."
1,"On the pretext of the US opposition, Japan was attempting to realize its own objective."
1,Japan should be condemned by the world for that.
1,This shows how capricious Japan is and how frequently it changes its stand when the stakes matter the most.
1,"Nonetheless, Japan is backing away from resolving the issue, although it is in a position to play a leading role."
1,It was expected that the protocol would be ratified by the countries that signed it and would have a legal binding force.
1,"The great leader [yongdoja] Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out the following: \n\t\n\t\n ""We should conduct proper research work to protect the environment, such as the air and water, in order to maintain people\'s health and provide them with more hygienic and civilized living conditions."""
1,"In discussing the draft regulations to put the ""Kyoto Protocol"" into force, Japan openly took issue with the draft regulations only because the contents of the regulations were not in its favor."
1,"Nonetheless, Japan, changing its stand this time, opposed the draft regulations to put the ""Kyoto Protocol"" into force and even called for liquidation of the draft."
1,"What Japan is doing with respect to the issue of putting the ""Kyoto Protocol"" into force is tantamount to an act of betrayal against mankind in the effort to protect human lives, health, and the earth\'s atmosphere."
1,How the problems of the global warming and environmental preservation are handled today will have a major impact on the lives and health of people as well as the future development of the world.
1,"According to the ""Kyoto Protocol,"" by 2008 - 2012 Japan is supposed to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by six percent from the 1990 level."
1,"According the ""Kyoto Protocol,"" developed countries are supposed to set goals to reduce greenhouse gases emission and officially put the ""Kyoto Protocol"" into force by the year 2002."
1,"The session of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change held this time was to reach on an actual agreement regarding regulatory problems that have to be solved to put the ""Kyoto Protocol"" adopted in 1997 into force, so that the world may reduce the greenhouse effect and ecological damage, which are becoming more serious with each passing day, protect human lives and health, and provide favorable conditions for the promotion of human civilization."
1,"At the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change held recently in Morocco, Japan laid artificial obstacles to the session by seeking its own profit."
0,"It has to restructure the plants and enterprises, introduce new technology, and upgrade production lines."
1,"This is the reason why many people of the world today are demanding that the world take concrete measures for protecting the environment, as they have come to realize its importance."
1,"If Japan is to achieve this goal, it will have to put a lot of effort."
1,"Japan will be unable to escape stronger denunciation and more serious isolation from the world, if it continues to seek only its own profit and create stumbling blocks, and does not do what it is supposed to do to prevent the global warming and seek environmental preservation."
1,"It is a well-known fact that the ""Kyoto Protocol"" was adopted at the Fifth Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Japan in 1997."
1,"The United States, which has to do the most to implement the ""Kyoto Protocol,"" has come out opposing the draft regulations."
1,That was a hint that it would not be good for Japan to play a leading role in dealing with a matter detrimental to US interests.
1,It grudgingly agreed to it only when some countries made concessions and made amendments to the draft.
1,Japan even called for working out practical measures to have it enter into force.
0,This means that Russia will be able to offer the carbon market emission quotas of up to 3 billion tons.
0,"According to estimates by the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Energy, Russia's total carbon-dioxide emissions in 2008-2012 will be 20 percent below the 1990 level."
1,Why don't I have the sense that the models explain everything?
1,"As for all the ideas regarding blocking shields, umbrellas and the like, I will answer this way."
1,"And what will happen during the new, overly warm summer seasons?"
0,This is the first international document that makes use of the market mechanism as an approach to solving global ecological problems.
1,"There are several models today, and they answer the question of why the climate is changing with varying degrees of persuasiveness."
1,No One Will Be Well Off
0,Participants in the debate also proceeded from the postulate that the earth's atmosphere has been heating up over the past 100 years.

1,Six greenhouse gases are known.
1,The cash equivalent could be several tens of billions of dollars.
0,"The US, Japan and members of the EU must reduce emissions by 7, 6 and 8 percent from the 1990 level."
0,"Nikolay Ratsiborinskiy, a senior adviser to the Foreign Ministry's Department of International Organizations, took up this role."
1,"The speaker's ardor was cooled by the well-known Sergey Kapitsa, who is not inclined to give way to rapture over the advantages promised to Russia."
1,"Some of the participants took the line that this is an extremely useful for Russia, which has ""hot air"" (that is, it is 30 percent short of the permitted level of CO2 emissions), and the country can become the dominant seller in the market; consequently, it has a greater stake than anyone in the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol."
0,The Obligations of Foreign Countries Under the Kyoto Protocol
0,This requires creating a national system of inventorying emissions and establishing a special registration center to maintain records of quotas.
1,"A consensus was arrived at that climate has always changed, but it has never occurred with such speed."
1,"Indeed, the idea has not yet captivated the masses so much that they would remove their last trousers to start investing immediately in the project."
0,"If the glaciers of Antarctica and Greenland melt down, the level of the world's oceans will rise."
1,"It isn\'t even the only cause of the increase in the greenhouse effect."""
0,"This is substantiated in detail in the RF Energy Strategy Until 2020, which the government has adopted."
1,"""The assessment by the Foreign Ministry official is brilliant,"" exclaimed Aleksandr Ginzburg, deputy director of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics."
0,We have just observed such a case of a very lengthy thaw in the center of Russia.
0,The discussants also presented differing views on the trading of air.
1,Should we be happy about climate change?
0,"In Russia, up to 98 percent of all emissions of the main greenhouse gas -- CO2 -- come from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas)."
0,"Russia has quite a lot of low-lying areas, such as St. Petersburg."
0,The principal one is CO2 (it is responsible for 80 percent of the greenhouse effect).
0,The convention was designed to unite efforts to prevent dangerous climate changes and to achieve a stabilization of the content of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a relatively safe level.
1,"For example, Prof. Viktor Danilov-Danilyan maintain that ""we must not speak of warming, but of global climatic changes; warming is merely one aspect of these changes."""
1,"In Mr. Gudkov's view, everything is developing well, we can take our time, and we can do nothing at all, since global warming is a threat only to the southern countries."
0,"In the polar regions, climate changes are more pronounced than in the middle latitudes."
0,"And a few days ago, on the initiative of the Foundation for Integrated Applied Research, the problem was taken up by well-known scientists."
0,"Russia signed the document three years ago, in March 1999."
1,"Gangster species are appearing, such as the locust, which is moving toward the north, where it has never been before."
1,"And if the States behave badly, we are simply obligated to ratify this document -- this was the conclusion arrived at by the round table."
1,"Six degrees, the professor believes, is unlikely, since that kind of thing has not happened on the planet in the past 420,000 years."
1,"Iceland, Japan, Australia and Canada are ready to join the ratification."
1,"In addition to the suggestion from the sixth continent, it is a good idea to recall the Great Flood, which has been depicted, apart from the Bible, in many of the world\'s mythologies: ""What was it?"
1,Many people in Russia say: how much fuel we'll save!
1,But to what extent does this reflect real life?
1,"""When we determine the position of the diplomatic service, we proceed from the premise that the whole strategy of nature-conservation efforts is not profitable but costly and that it is impossible to solve the problems of environmental protection on our own... The Kyoto mechanism is costly, but its value lies in the fact that its implementation has been tied to the market mechanism, that is, life without change has been made uneconomical."""
0,"That is, all of our actions are accompanied by a deterioration in the climate."
1,"On the contrary, they found solidarity in the view that it is impossible to explain everything with models."
1,They are relatively mild for our country.
1,"True, the sun-screening space umbrella (the author\'s name) does not have much chance of opening up, due to ""political-economic circumstances."""
1,There are no proposals there to erect screens or to shoot cooling aerosols into the atmosphere.
1,The world community became hopeful that it would be possible to solve the problems that brought about the UN Convention on Climate Change (1994).
0,"The expert immediately sketched on a blackboard what this should look like, mixing up chemical symbols: rockets would carry metallic sodium into orbits around the earth."

1,All of Our Activities Are Ruining Nature
0,It provides for economic mechanisms of international cooperation.
0,Russia's Obligations Under the Kyoto Protocol
1,This is just the time to recall that the energy requirements of Russian output are among the highest in the world (see graph [omitted here] -- Ed.).
0,"As a result, the temperature doesn't change much in the equatorial and middle latitudes but changes a great deal in the polar regions."
0,"So far this potential has been utilized only to a small degree, whereas there are almost no such reserves left in the EU countries and Japan."
0,"This approach is based on the fact that Russia's emissions today are almost 25 percent lower than in 1990, and, according to forecasts, the baseline level will not be reached in the next 10 years."
1,"Models are flawed, including the greenhouse model, and the only thing that is beyond dispute is that warming is underway, and the contribution of human beings to this alarming condition is very large, possible at least 30 percent."
1,"What will happen to industrial and transport facilities, housing and other infrastructure that were built in permafrost, which will turn into muddy swamp?"
1,"Consequently, if our homeland\'s efforts boil down merely to dealing in ""hot air,"" this will not provide an impetus to start up high technologies and will knock Russia out of the group of countries that are striving for rational development, above all out of the European Union."
0,"This meant, in effect, that the US withdrew from the accords."
0,Some terminological refinements came up as well.
1,"A decision was adopted at the first conference of convention participants (1995, Berlin) to begin phased actions to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases and to create an appropriate system of ecological-economic relations."
0,"American at first signed the document, but a year ago President Bush announced that he would not impose regulations in his country on the discharge of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere."
0,The enormous territory of Western Siberia risks turning into a sea.
0,"A small circle of experts, in the presence of an even smaller circle of journalists, attempted to define Russia's place in global climatic strategy."
0,What Preceded the Kyoto Protocol?
0,"During a general warming, completely opposite phenomena take place."
1,"What is cited as the reason for them, the scientist continues, ""is almost always the increase in the greenhouse effect due to a larger concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."
1,That is why carrying out a project and reducing emissions in Russia is far cheaper than in most developed countries.
1,"It is hard to say today what will happen to edaphic microflora, which is of fundamental importance to soil fertility."
0,It was preceded by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
1,"The Foreign Ministry, said N. Ratsiborinskiy, clarifying his agency's position, recommends that the government move to ratify, since the view at Smolenskaya Square is that the impact of our national efforts will be greater if they are integrated into the efforts of the EU."
1,"The 15 member nations of the EU announced last fall, at a conference in Morocco, their firm intentions to ratify the Kyoto Protocol."
1,"In this situation it is very frightening to do anything else -- for example, to suspend some umbrella, screen or something else in that vein."
1,The problem is that the present stage of study of small climatic models has scientists studying the life of the models as the life of a real climatic system.
1,"There are no results to speak of yet, but it is important that this area of inquiry has appeared."
1,"It is another matter that the reasons for this alarming phenomenon are not completely clear, and experts offer different interpretations of the consequences of global warming."
1,Those in attendance did not argue.
1,The unbalancing of the climate will have a very negative effect on ecosystems.
1,"Our country has something like a controlling block of shares, since without Russia and the US the Kyoto Protocol will die."
0,"If microflora stop reproducing humus, the higher plants will die, agricultural crops will stop growing, and timber will start to dry up."
1,"Nevertheless, the progress in gaining knowledge has been tremendous."
0,"The gist is that, according to the Kyoto terms, quotas can be sold, that is, if you have fewer emissions than your neighbor, then you have every reason to strike an advantageous deal."
0,"We will also gain from the fact that compliance by other nations with the terms of the protocol will lead to higher demand for gas, of which we have huge resources."
1,"""This is the best thing I have read or heard about the Kyoto Protocol!"
1,"Rumor has it that the late author of the greenhouse model told Academician Roald Sagdeyev: ""I\'m a little uneasy when I tell the Americans about my model, because it suggests that Russia\'s agriculture will gain from global warming, while America\'s agriculture will lose."" Sagdeyev looked at Budyko with interest: ""But then where will we buy grain?"""
0,The document that was given the name of the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 in the Japanese city of Kyoto.
1,"In his view, it would not be a bad idea, when the scientific community draws up all sorts of forecasts and plans of action that flow out of them, for it to seek help from the science of paleoclimatology and to gain a broad understanding of its data."
0,"As of today, more than 80 nations (all the developed countries and almost all of the CIS countries) have signed the Kyoto Protocol, and almost 40 have ratified it."
0,What does this lead to?
0,"A limitation, rather than reduction, of emissions is specified for several developed countries (New Zealand, Norway), and Australia and Iceland received the right to increase emissions."
1,No one wanted to argue with the master.
0,There is a Proposal to Take Shelter Under an Umbrella
1,The Kyoto Protocol proposes adapting to climate change.
0,Russia's emissions are almost twice as great as those of Germany and Japan (in fourth and fifth places).
1,"And now Andrey Gudkov, an expert at the Center for Strategic Studies, follows Budyko in insisting that Russia, as well as Canada and Alaska, gain, since ""lands situated in a condition of permafrost will gradually turn into fertile soils for agricultural production."""
0,"Within the framework of the protocol our country must maintain records of, and monitor, emissions and emission quotas, as well as regulate quotas."
0,Cooling aerosols dispersed over the polar zones would prevent overheating of the tundra during sunny summer nights.

0,It was aimed at reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and assigns countries quotas on their emissions.
1,"True, this clause has been stirring up a lot of questions for a long time."
1,He also questions the predicted amount of future warming.
1,"True, this position makes one think of Yemelya's [illusory] happiness and worry about the future development of the country (both technological and economic as a whole)."
1,"Fortunately, supporters of the idea of lying on a stove found an opponent."
0,"This concentration grows, in turn, it is usually written, due to the burning of a huge quantity of organic fuel (oil, natural gas, coal, wood, peat, etc.) by industry, transport, agriculture and households."
1,"Incidentally, last year's incredibly cold winter in Primorskiy Kray was very possibly an example of the same property."
1,But the warming will definitely not be uniform.
1,On the agenda of tomorrow's meeting of the Russian government is the question of ratification of the Kyoto Protocol -- a highly important international document that is supposed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
1,""" It is hard to disagree with this."
0,"We are not required to reduce emissions, but over five years (from 2008 through 2012) we do not have the right to exceed their volume."
1,"But the expert urged everyone to despair, ""since control of global warming without Russia is impossible; the country is becoming the owner of the controlling block of shares."""
1,If One Lies on a Stove...
0,"A total of 186 nations are parties to the convention, including Russia, all of the developed countries and all of the CIS countries."
0,The Ecological-Economic Meaning of the Kyoto Protocol
1,"But the rich Russian fields that stretch across the Arctic zone are small comfort to humankind as a whole, so Gudkov proposes blocking off the sun with an umbrella that would be suspended in space."
1,"This is indicated by a well drilled in the ice cap of Antarctica 30 years ago, which helps to comprehend what has happened to climate."
1,"If a country fails to use up its quota, it can sell the ""surplus."""
0,"Dispersion is less active, and so-called obstruction or stagnant situation manifest themselves in the atmosphere more and more often."
1,"We emit greenhouse gases, we thaw out the frozen regions that emit methane, we destroy forests, and in the south, deserts are expanding, a process that alters the heat exchange between the earth's surface and the atmosphere."
1,"Despite the outward complexity of the task, the creation of a record-keeping and monitoring system is neither very complicated nor very expensive, since the Goskomstat [State Statistical Committee] reporting forms that enterprises fill out contain virtually complete data."
0,"If the mean temperature rises by 2 degrees, the range of fluctuations will widen and will go, for example, from -40 to +45 degrees."
1,"In short, if you don't want to exert yourself, buy the neighbor's quota; if you don't want to spend the money, use your brain and invest in the development of nature-conservation technologies."
1,"So if anyone doubts whether Russia should ratify the document, he is deeply mistaken."
0,This means the problem of reducing emissions is a problem of energy efficiency and energy saving.
1,He pointed out that U.S. President George Bush's decision to sell arms to Taiwan last April was made to avoid an imbalance of cross-strait military force by 2005 on the one hand and to further safeguard Taiwan's democratic achievements on the other.
1,"23 (CNA) -- Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian expressed the hope Wednesday that the United States will help Taiwan's bid for observer status in the World Health Organization (WHO), following its assistance to Taiwan's World Trade Organization (WTO) membership bid."

1,Lash in return congratulated Chen on Taiwan's WTO entry and said that his visit shows that the United States attaches great importance to U.S.-Taiwan trade relations.
1,Chen also expressed hope that the United States will negotiate with Taiwan to sign a free trade zone agreement between the two countries so as to help Taiwan's internalization and to give it more international responsibility.
1,"Taiwan's WTO access has given Taiwan a window to the world, a window to the century and a window of opportunity, he went on, adding that it will allow Taiwan to upgrade its competitiveness and help U.S.-Taiwan trade relations."
1,He congratulated Chen on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party becoming the biggest political party in the Legislative Yuan with last December's legislative election.

0,"[Passage omitted -- on the Bush administration's budget for controlling climate changes; the attitudes of Australia, Canada, the European Union, and China; and the terms of the Kyoto Protocol]"
1,"No matter how cynical this may appear, the US administration is mainly concerned with getting out of the recession and with relaunching the economy, rather than with the greenhouse effect."
1,"The US President preferred a more realistic attitude, because it is hard to believe that it will be possible to fully eliminate pollutant gas emissions in one decade."
1,"""Of course he would not use the term of `peaceful reunification\' ... because the American position is that relations between Taiwan and China should be open-ended,"" Chang said."
0,"""The three communiques have not committed the US to peaceful reunification,"" he added."
1,Bush reitered his desire for a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue several times during his trip to Beijing.
1,"The US' rising concerns over China's military expansion and its appreciation for Taipei's support for the US-led war against terrorism drove Bush to stand firm in his support for Taiwan, the DPP legislator said."
0,Cheng pointed out what he saw as the implications of Bush's remarks on missile defense.
1,"Bush described Taiwan as a ""good friend"" of the US during his weekly radio address to the US public that aired last week within hours of his departure for Asia."
1,The Pentagon's quadrennial defense review issued last September -- which highlighted the rising Chinese threat -- and the recent testimony by the CIA director to the US Senate on China's military modernization were indicative of the Bush administration's perception of China as a growing threat to US national security.
1,"But Bush's refusal to respond to a similar push by a student yesterday during the question-and-answer session of his talk at Tsinghua University showed that the US president stuck to the US existing policy, according to analysts."
1,"China has tried to highlight and accentuate the Taiwan issue during Bush's trip to China, but the US agenda rested instead on anti-terrorism and China's proliferation of arms sale to countries like Iran and Pakistan, Chang argued."
1,"""Bush has made the first correct step by spurning his predecessor\'s appeasement of China."
1,"""We felt gratified and relieved after watching Bush stick to his principles on the issue of Taiwan."
1,"Although he did not mention Taiwan directly, the implication of this remark seemed to be that Taiwan was not to be excluded,"" Cheng said."
1,"Former US president Bill Clinton agitated Taiwan when he gave the so-called ""three nos"" speech during his visit to China in 1998."
1,"While past trips to China by US presidents have produced agreements or statements that have damaged Taiwan's interests, Bush's visit only enhanced the nation's confidence in his administration, Cheng said."
1,STATE VISIT: The US president is getting good reviews from political experts for refusing to restate the `three nos' and declining to endorse peaceful reunification
1,"Bush's mention several times of the Taiwan Relations Act, the 1979 US law that pledged that the US would supply Taiwan with the defensive weapons it needed to fend off a Chinese attack, also reflected his firm support for Taiwan, analysts said."
1,"Notably, he didn\'t restate the so-called `three nos\' policy,"" said DPP legislator Parris Chang (Chang Hsu-ch\'eng) of Bush\'s remarks on Taiwan during his two-day trip to Beijing that concluded yesterday afternoon."
1,"But as Bush concluded his trip to Asia yesterday, it was clear that China failed to elicit from him a statement on the ""three nos"" and on opposition to Taiwanese independence, Chang said."

1,"Contrary to the preceding one, the plan proposed by Washington Thursday thus no longer has any binding procedure and is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives."
1,They explain that this agreement is an important step for the EU in fulfilling the political pledge to achieve ratification of the Protocol before the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development.

1,Israel's persistent and deliberate fuelling of the cycle of violence in the Palestinian territories is pushing our already turbulent region towards inevitable chaos and war.
1,"And therefore, it has blatantly obstructed all international, US, European, and regional efforts to consolidate an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire as a prerequisite for the implementation of the Mitchell and Tenet recommendations."
1,"The US expects its friends to provide it with understanding, cooperation and full support in confronting the perpetrators of the devastating attack on its centres of economic and military power."
1,Many observers inside and outside the region had rightly feared that Israel would callously exploit the Sept. 11 tragedy in the US to intensify and accelerate its aggression against the Palestinians and crush their efforts towards claiming their legitimate rights to freedom and independence.
1,This behaviour further confirms what has long been very clear; the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is more interested in pursuing its expansionist designs on occupied Palestinian and Arab land than in engaging in serious peace-making -- a route that would require its unreserved commitment.

1,There is an evident international resolve to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its aspects.
1,"As the entire world is engaged in handling one of the most serious crises of our time, it is about time that Sharon and his government realise that predatory behaviour will not be tolerated for long."
1,"But instead of reciprocating, Israel, the state that since its creation has benefited most from US protection and backing, has turned out to be a fair-weather friend."
1,"The calls from Washington and London for the just and legitimate realisation of Palestinian statehood as part of such a settlement, should be viewed by the Israeli leadership as a guarantee of Israel's peace and security, but continued violence and aggression, as history has shown time and again, is a recipe for disaster."
1,"The Sharon government is doing exactly that, in total disregard and utter defiance and disrespect of advice from Washington and London, as well as other governments, for restraint and a quick return to the negotiating table."
1,"The US official told reporters traveling with Powell en route to Shanghai for an APEC meeting that he unequivocally denied the Washington Post report that said the Bush administration was considering such a move, specifically to allow sales of spare parts for mainland Chinese-owned helicopters as another weapon in the US war on terrorism."

1,"18 (CNA) -- The Republic of China government believes in the US commitment to separating its anti-terrorism campaign from the Taiwan Strait issue, a senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday."
1,"Noting that the United States has consistently attached great importance to Asia-Pacific regional stability and security, Kao said the robust US arms sales package to Taiwan struck in April this year signifies that the United States is serious about security in the region."
1,"Prior to his departure for Shanghai, Bush said during his meeting with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, he will reaffirm to Jiang the US support for the ""one China"" policy as well as its desire to see a peaceful solution to all disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait."
1,"Stanley Kao, director of MOFA's North American Affairs Department, made the remarks amid mounting concerns about the possibility that the United States could compromise Taiwan's interests in exchange for mainland China's cooperation in the current US-led war on global terrorism."
0,"""There\'s no such sale or waiver contemplated,"" he said."
1,"Afghanistan is now under US bombardment for refusing to hand over the chief suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, Saudi-born dissident Osama bin Laden [Usama Bin Ladin]."

1,"Powell said: Bush\'s statement is similar to that of Ronald Reagan who described former USSR as an ""Evil Empire."""
1,The United States does not rule out the possibility of holding dialogues with the countries of the Axis of Evil.
1,"Secretary of State Colin Powell said on 5 February that it was not an alarmist remark when George W. Bush labeled Iran, Iraq, and the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea [DPRK] as the ""Axis of Evil"" when he was delivering the State of the Union Speech last week."
1,The United States is ready to cooperate with its allies and discuss with them how to deal with such regimes.
0,"Hong Kong, 6 Feb (ZTS) News from Washington:"
1,"Powell\'s remark came when he attended a hearing sponsored by the Foreign Relations Committee of the US Senate and spoke in defense of the statement of the ""Axis of Evil"" which has been widely criticized."
1,Powell said: The need to take actions against these countries does not mean that we will launch a war against or invade someone tomorrow.
1,"According a report, during his two-hour discourse, Powell said that it is correct to describe Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK as the ""Axis of Evil."" He said: But this does not mean that the United States will launch a war against them."
1,"In the near future, this means that the United States will consider the three countries mentioned and other countries that might be mentioned as the major points of its policy."
1,"4 February was such a failure that Chavez, even though it pained him, had to accept democratic methods to reach power."
1,4 February is one of the most terrible days in Venezuelan history.
1,"In what way can Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez be seen as comparable to Jose Felix Ribas, Francisco Salias, the philosopher Juan German Roscio, or Canon Jose Cortes de Madariaga?"
1,We must prevent his attempt to exercise power as if he had won on 4 February.
1,"President Chavez himself now boasts of having spent 20 years conspiring -- that is, eroding the armed forces' loyalty -- to achieve his goal of conquering power."
1,Venezuelan democracy has not given anyone as much as it gave Chavez.
1,"He asserted, in these exact words, this barbarism: ""4 February is not just any date, it is a historic date we can well compare to 19 April 1810, when that civic-military rebellion also opened a new path towards national independence."""
1,"This was not the case, and the Venezuelan people rejected him as a coup participant."
1,"There were numerous deaths, and no one can feel proud of the consequences."
1,"4 February was not only a military failure for Chavez; it was also an episode that caused enormous losses, human and economic, for all Venezuelans."
1,"Seeing in believing, and the longer you live the more you see."
1,"4 February upset the lives of Venezuelans with the ghost of a military insurgency that we had all thought had been overcome, because it belonged to past eras and because the armed forces were fully within the legitimate order, complying with institutional precepts, far from the meddling forbidden by the constitution."
1,Comparing it with 19 April 1810 is another armed coup and must be rejected with all determination by the academies and by those who in one way or another must preserve our historical legacy from adulteration or deceitful use.
1,"The reason for this is simple: He has to respect the democratic rules of the game, the freedom of expression that causes him so many nightmares, the presence of the fundamental institutions of the nation whose right to exist he denies."
1,This is a great demonstration of political cynicism.
1,What is there about a coup against the constitutional order that could resemble the most important day in Venezuelan history?
1,"That was what happened in 1998, and still today, Chavez gives constant demonstrations of discontent and irritation at having been democratically elected."
1,"If he wants to look for a comparison, maybe he would find one in the likewise thwarted coup by Colonel Pedro Carujo against Jose Maria Vargas."
1,"He should acknowledge these debts and make the effort to learn to live in a democracy, respecting others' rights."
1,"This is a simple lack of respect, an abuse of history, an unacceptable degradation."
1,"Chavez did not try to overthrow Fernando VII, and if it had been up to him we would still be under the domination of the Bourbon dynasty."
1,"No one had gone so far in the anthology of rhetorical follies, or in falsifying history."
1,"He wants to disguise the failed date of 4 February to create the collective illusion of a military victory, which would permit him to govern us from Miraflores as if he really had reached power that day."
1,"In fact, the armed forces made great contributions to the country's stability, because when each sector of Venezuelan society complies with what is set out for it in the legal order, countries are preserved from the vicissitudes of coup plotters."
1,"No one had ever tried to compare themselves to, and put themselves in the same position, as the founders of the nation, as the thwarted leader of the 4 February 1992 coup has now tried to do."
1,"Once he was taken prisoner, democracy exhausted all its generosity, just as Vargas did with Carujo."
1,"Imagine what would have happened to us Venezuelans if in fact on that terrible day the lieutenant colonel, instead of staying in the museum, had advanced on the government building with the vast forces backing him."
1,Trying to destroy it now is inconsistent.
1,"It was written, the episode was broadcast live, and there was no way that those words from the president of the Republic were adulterated, deformed, or falsified by the hidden agents of the media conspiracy."
1,"Today, with this official ""celebration,"" Venezuela is in mourning."
0,This system of freedoms made him president of the Republic.
1,"Oddly enough, speculations swirled in Washington that Powell listened to President Bush\'s speech and his threats to ""the axis of evil"" like any other US citizen."
1,A catastrophe would engulf every country if the US arms industry progressed at the expense of the world's security and stability.
1,"The United States is these days ruled by an alliance between two main lobbies, the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, which sees the world through the eyes of Ari'el Sharon and his extremist government."
1,"He does not want to repeat his father's mistake, being defeated in the next elections because of economic factors."
1,"US Secretary of State Colin Powell, described as one of the few enlightened officials in President Bush\'s administration, is trying to ""patch up"" President Bush\'s statements, especially his latest one in which he made reckless threats at the ""axis of evil,"" namely Iran, Iraq and North Korea."
1,"At any rate, Secretary Powell\'s remark about the US administration\'s readiness to enter dialogue with these ""evil"" states and with Washington\'s friends on ways of dealing with them involves some contradictions."
1,The fact that he subsequently denied these speculations does not mean they are baseless.
1,"The current US administration will consult with no one, not even its closest allies, whether in Europe or its followers in the Third World, particularly in the Arab world."
1,He is therefore planning to trigger wars here and there to revive the flagging arms industry.
1,"The US administration has already decided to ""punish"" any country it believes poses a danger to the Hebrew State."
0,President Bush is facing a recession and an economic crisis.
1,For he affirmed in the first speech that there would be no dialogue with Iraq until after it has accepted the return of the UN arms inspectors.
1,"These are fine words, but they do not reflect the reality, because the hard-line wing in the US administration comprising Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice have the final say in running affairs at the White House, and have direct influence on President Bush."
1,"A day after President Bush\'s threat to crush these countries and use all means to prevent them from developing weapons of mass destruction, Secretary Powell said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that ""characterizing these counties as the axis of evil does not mean that his government intends to invade them."""
1,"It lumped North Korea with Iran and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" only to mislead Arabs and Muslims and to create the impression that Islam is not alone targeted."
1,"He added: ""We are prepared to initiate a dialogue, and we want to work with our friends and allies in the world on ways of dealing with such regimes."""
1,"This mentality simultaneously raises apprehensions and resentment, because international economic prosperity can be built on stability, not wars."
1,We therefore have to expect the worst in the near future.
1,"He had not read the speech before President Bush delivered it, as he was supposed to do by virtue of his post."
1,"The United States is currently run by a typical Texan mentality, which is closer to that of cowboys than to a civilized mentality that believes in dialogue and coexistence among peoples."
1,"In the latter case, the blame for this fruitless effort belongs not to the stinginess of the US Government but rather to a mix of shortsightedness and irresponsibility among Argentine leaders."
1,An accord with the governors would be a clear sign that public spending was going to be brought under control where it is most out of control.
1,"And the budget would have been a message from the political community at large, not just from the president and his top ministers, that the zero deficit program enjoys a consensus."
1,"De la Rua waited anxiously until Saturday evening for his cabinet chief, Chrystian Colombo, to at least announce that an accord with the Peronist governors would be signed on Monday (this would also have been a sign about the budget, because of the influence that the governors have over their provincial lawmakers)."
1,"As if not enough messages in this regard had been conveyed through a thousand different channels, the powerful head of the National Security Council, Condoleeza Rice, who is Bush's chief adviser, put it bluntly in public remarks last Thursday that came close to representing interference in the country's domestic affairs."
1,"The Treasury Department, however, in spite of the good offices of its number two man, John Taylor, is still taking the cool approach towards Argentina that its head, Paul O'Neill, had adopted."
1,In this sort of crisis there can never be just one guilty party.
1,Rice even went so far as to mention the need for political leadership in Argentina to resolve its economic crisis.
1,The new federal pact will necessarily mean that those who won the elections will have to give up funding.
1,"Domingo Cavallo was not at the meeting with Bush because his president, seeing that his hands would be empty, wanted to ignore economic issues at the summit."
1,"The president, in turn, was supposed to give evidence of his ability to manage the conflict."
1,"The Argentine Government wants fresh funds in order to reschedule its debt, funds that could come from the International Monetary Fund or the US Treasury itself."
1,"President Fernando de la Rua, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo The summit between George W. Bush and Fernando de la Rua may have changed many things, but it may also have changed nothing."
1,"Argentina had to show the world that the decision to reschedule its public debt is not a default in disguise; moreover, the success of the most recent economic plan is at stake."
1,"Colombo called him up, but only to tell him that it had all been in vain."
1,"Among US Government institutions, the State Department is the one most inclined to help Argentina, followed by the Security Council, albeit less enthusiastically."
1,"The political accords reached in New York were noteworthy, because the Argentine Government supported all of the US Government's present and future needs in the war in Afghanistan."
1,"A less utopian wish is to get multilateral agencies, or some of them, to guarantee the Argentine offers to its creditors."
1,That sort of meeting would have lent a noteworthy twist to the Argentine case.
1,"In spite of all this, our politicians did not meet either of the requirements that were described in detail from abroad: there had to be an agreement between the national government and the provinces in connection with revenue sharing, and Peronism also had to send a clear-cut message that it would help get the 2002 budget passed in Congress."
1,"Argentine leaders, regardless of their leanings, were thus supposed to demonstrate their commitment to economic austerity and their determination to confirm and honor the institutional timetable of the De la Rua administration."
1,How could the United States be asked to do such a thing if Argentina was unable to show a modicum of internal political discipline in advance?
1,"Why put emphasis on economic issues, on the only area in which failure would be a foregone conclusion?"
1,"The De la Rua administration has an even more urgent need: regardless of what might be said, Argentina needs the IMF to disburse as soon as possible more than $1.2 billion that is scheduled for December."
1,"In either of these cases, Washington had to be convinced that Argentina deserved bailing out and then act accordingly."
1,It was also quite naive to think that Peronism would readily reach an agreement with a defeated administration.
1,"The government is also paying the price for its delays in putting together a plan in the wake of its electoral defeat, with interest payments on the public debt maturing very soon as well."
1,He realized that nothing would come of a meeting whose demands had been clearly stated and then not met.
1,"Argentina, which in recent days has again been making all of the world's newspapers in the worst sort of way, had to fulfill these requirements because it needed to gain Washington's active, not just verbal, support."
1,"First off, Bush could have brought discipline to his administration in connection with the case of Argentina."
1,But those were the US needs.
1,"The Argentine Foreign Ministry had previously stopped importuning Brasilia to have Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Argentine President De la Rua meet jointly with Bush, as they had agreed to do at the most recent meeting between the two countries in Sao Paulo."
1,"USP [University of Sao Paulo] professor Emir Sader believes that Peronists will remain in power after the elections, slowly growing weaker, allowing room for the emergence of new leadership."
1,"""The degree of pauperization will be brutal."
1,"Either one pays attention to the will of the people or what happened will happen."" Maia commented."
1,"The Argentine TV station Todo Noticias [""All News""] reported yesterday that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Saturday night telephoned Cordoba Province Governor Jose Manuel de la Sota, of the Justicialist Party (PJ) -- who once served as ambassador to Brazil -- to voice his concern over incidents in the country."
1,"Brazil cannot stand by with its hands folded just watching all of this,"" Genoino affirmed."
1,"I hope that this can alert the Brazilian Government to revise its relationship with the IMF."""
1,"He noted, ""Brazil should adopt an open posture with relation to Argentina, which is experiencing a tragedy."""
1,"For the political scientist, Argentina cannot wait for assistance from the American Government."
1,This is viewed as the main impediment to the establishment of political order in the country.
1,"Violent attacks at the Argentine legislature sounded alarm bells in the Brazilian political arena, to the point that senators of the official and opposition parties defended more concrete support from the Brazilian Government for Argentina."
1,We have a very risky scenario.
1,The concern now is security.
1,"He asked that Brazil promote meetings in the South American continent, or serve as intermediary in negotiations with international institutions."
1,Any step backward for democracy on the continent would be a disaster.
1,"All eyes are on Pakistan, China, and Russia."""
1,"According to the reporter, the Brazilian president apparently advised De la Sota to move forward the elections, initially slated for March 2002."
1,"""Cardoso told De la Sota that the images of the protests at the Plaza de Mayo show a country on the verge of a civil war,"" one of the channel\'s journalists commented."
1,"""The political warning must be heeded."
1,"We don't know where it will go, against whom."
0,But neither Itamaraty nor the Planalto Palace confirmed the president's phone call to the governor of Cordoba.
1,"""This is an unpredictable, anarchical situation."
1,"Senator Heloisa Helena (Workers Party -- Alagoas) said that Latin American countries should always join together to speak with international economic institutions, in order to maintain autonomy in their economies: ""Now we see what happens when one country abdicates its financial autonomy."
1,"Sader affirmed, ""The new policy of (US President George W.) Bush is to permit decay."
1,Deputy Jose Genoino (Workers Party -- Sao Paulo) said that the wave of looting threatens Argentine democracy.
1,Concern has spread to Brazilian legislators.
0,PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] President Jose Anibal (Sao Paulo) said that Cardoso has already placed himself at the disposal of the Argentine Government to talk to international financial institutions.
1,"Everything depends on how long it takes for Peronism to burn out and new leadership to emerge,"" Sader said."
1,Analysts: Lack of Alternative for Power
0,"In addition to Argentina there are other countries in crisis, such as Colombia and Venezuela."
1,"For Jose Agripino Maia, PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader in the Senate, although Brazil has detached itself from Argentina, it should not disregard the message of the crises that is devastating the neighboring country."
1,Latin America is no longer important because the focus now is on global security and no longer on the international economic order.
1,Legislators Request Action from the Brazilian Government
1,Political scientists agree: Argentina lacks a political force that can stand up to Peronism and Radicalism.
1,"We have to wait until the elections are over before concluding."""

0,Fiji was only readmitted to the Commonwealth in January after being expelled following the 2000 coup.

1,"Bush deliberate used the term to emphasize to the world the adversarial US position toward the three countries that, according to Washington's claim, still assist terrorists and seek to develop lethal weapons."

1,"In the presidential election, he campaigned on economic and education issues and barely scraped through."
1,"As Bush has declared that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are the ""Axis of Evil,"" it emphatically implies that he regards it as duty to stop them from manufacturing or acquiring lethal weapons, be they chemical, biological, or nuclear."
1,"It is not enough that he sees those countries as evil, he wants his allies to feel the same way about them as well."
1,"The US naming of North Korea may annoy China, given its assistance to the United States in the war in Afghanistan."
1,"The word ""axis"" reminds me of the grouping of countries during World War I and II that were enemies of the Allies."

0,The events on 11 September forced Bush to overhaul the US foreign policy.
1,The world has heated up a notch.
1,The line that Bush draws between friends and foes has never been any clearer.
1,"Although the US role is identified as participation in military exercise or as adviser, the real purpose is the soldiers are sent there to participate in missions that the targets are the groups that are regarded as enemies of the United States."

1,"After he set forth the ""Axis of Evil"" theory in his State of the Union speech, Bush met with increasing attacks from the international community."
1,Albright particularly noted that she had contacted and reached agreement with the DPRK.
1,"An US government official said that US diplomats to countries concerned are authorized to explain to these countries which may have doubts about Bush's State of the Union speech, this is aimed at dispelling various countries' doubt that the United States is about to dispatch troops to Iran, Iraq and Korea."
1,"She said that the principle Bush currently uses in handling foreign affairs has caused the international community to think that the United States is doing things ""in an utterly disorderly way"" and has ""lost reason""."
0,"Iran also indicated that in case US pilots were hit in Afghanistan and landed in Iran, Iran would give them assistance."
1,Chirac's assistant indicated that the good-and-evil view does not conform to the actual conditions in the present-day world.

1,"The French presidential office does not make open comments on Bush's statement, it only says that what Bush says is directed mainly to the Americans."
1,Now President Bush has completely closed the door to improvement of ties with Iran.
1,"When George W. Bush was delivering the State of the Union Speech to both Senate and the House of Representatives of US Congress on 29 January, with unprecedented wordings he lashed out at DPRK (the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea), Iran and Iraq, labeling the three countries as the ""Axis of Evil""."

0,Albright: First to Launch Attack
0,"After the events in Washington and New York, approximately 1,000 Pakistanis were thrown into jail, and one person, Mohammed Butt, died of heart failure during detention."
0,"As a result, the governments in Guatemala in 1954 and 1963, Dominican Republic in 1984, Brazil in 1965 and that of Chile in 1973 were toppled."
1,"Instead of blindly accepting every demand made by the United States and responding positively to every American phone call, Pakistan should take every single step carefully."
1,"Pakistan should draw its own conclusions in the light of its own circumstances, from this report issued by China."
1,Pakistan also needs to rethink in this regard.
0,The media also reported that 120 Israeli spies were arrested and were exiled from the United States on the orders of the Department of Justice.

1,"As a result, the United States formed a coalition with the aim of bringing an end to terrorism and the Taliban, due to which bombardment is still continuing in Afghanistan."
1,The CIA was given the task to topple governments and install rulers of its own choice.
1,The way in which Pakistan has been fully supporting the United States after 11 September 2001--the total benefit of that has been earned by the United States.
1,Apparently President Bush's attitude looks like a reaction to the events of 11 September 2001.
1,In the document serious criticism was made on the expanding military presence by the United States at the international level and it was demanded that the United States should stop the policy of dominating the world.
1,"According to China, the American society is engulfed by violence and crime."
1,"It has been clearly mentioned in various documents including the US National Security Council memorandum number 68 issued in 1950, that US supremacy has to be maintained at any cost."
1,"Encouraged by the global community's shameful silence, the United States has announced the second phase of its war against terrorism."
1,"It can be derived from this that the US attack on Afghanistan without any logic, was not an impulsive action but the psychology of maintaining US supremacy was fully involved in it."
1,The United States has never tried to make a self-assessment.
1,"The Iranian President Mohammed Khatami, on the start of his visit to Austria, protested against this dictatorial move by the United States."
1,The actual US objective is the protection of its own interests worldwide for which it does not care for any moral values.
1,This not only shows the double standards of the US but also its selfishness.
1,It is possible that the United States itself planned this suicidal attack.
1,"After the 11 September suicide bomb attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the United States, instead of investigating the matter and coming up with proof, put all the blame for terrorism on Afghanistan."
1,The above-mentioned statement by China is the first ever by an important country after the 11 September events in the United States.
1,Racial prejudice has assumed alarming proportions.
1,Five hundred Taliban prisoners arrested from Afghanistan are being kept in cages on an island near Cuba.
1,"During the same period, anti-Soviet hysteria was also promoted strongly."
1,This also exposes the background of keeping the US troops and military basis in different parts of the world.
1,"Therefore, China is justified in demanding that the United States, by creating conflicts and by embarking upon the policy of oppression and supremacy should stop interfering in the affairs of other countries in the name of human rights."
0,The Middle East and many countries of the Third World were part of the plan.
1,These prisoners have been placed in inhuman conditions and the reason for keeping them on this island is that US law does not apply there.
1,"North Korea has also been made the target due to the reason that according to the United States, it is being blamed for transferring nuclear technology and weapons to Islamic countries."
0,A detailed document has been issued after China's recent State of Council session [as published].
0,No court case was made against the others arrested nor they were given the right to defend themselves.
1,"In the document, the United States has been very openly told that it has become the number one country in damaging solidarity of other countries and violating human rights there."
1,This report [above-mentioned document by China] should be an eye opener for the whole world and the United States should be viewed in its true perspective.
1,"The seven countries which the US terms as a threat to its security and against which it can use nuclear weapons, also include Russia and China."
1,"As a lesson to others!\n, various American TV channels, daily, show shots of the conditions under which these prisoners are being kept."
1,"This can be traced back to the events in 1818, when American cowboys used blind force to oppress the blacks."
1,There is no protection of women rights including their respect and sanctity.
1,"According to the analysis of Chomsky, after World War II, the US think tank had planned to subjugate a few regions of the world for its economic progress."
1,"By declaring Iraq, Iran and North Korea as 'axis of evil', the United States has announced to target these countries in the same manner as !\nAfghanistan."
1,"Since then, the United States has been raising artificial slogans of preservation of democracy and human rights and developing standards of living."
1,American intellectual Noam Chomsky has proved in his writings that the accomplishment of its goals by aggression and terrorism is a part of the American psyche.
1,Pakistan has not only earned a bad name but also its internal and external problems have increased manifold.
1,"It is due to this hegemony, which the United States wants to maintain, that its State Department makes an assessment of the human rights situation in different countries and prepares a report on their violations all over the world."
1,"Above all, the US media has reported that the involvement of Jews in the 11 September events cannot be ruled out."

1,"The South African government had taken note of the reports from various observer missions, including the Commonwealth, which had also urged ""all Zimbabweans to put aside their differences and to work together for the future of the country"", the statement said."
1,"In terms of the Commonwealth's mandate, action against Zimbabwe could range from collective disapproval to suspension should it be decided that Mugabe was returned to power undemocratically."
0,"As a member of these organisations, South Africa would await these reports before responding definitively on the issue."
1,He was unable to explain the apparent contradiction.
1,"""Both the Deputy President and President Mugabe agreed on the need for continued consultation and co-operation between the two governments to address economic matters such as the shortage of grain, and continued co-operation, trade and investments and a number of other bilateral issues."""
1,He said the South African government was happy with the SAOM report that the elections were legitimate.
0,"""On the basis of all these reports and consultations, and proceeding from the principle that South Africa will act as part of a collective international effort, a comprehensive statement will be made in due course."
1,SAOM head Sam Motsuenyane said in a radio interview on Thursday that although the election was legitimate it stopped short of being free and fair.
1,"Other reports included one from the Southern African Development Community\'s council of ministers who declared the election ""substantially free and fair"" and the other from the Organisation of African Unity which said ""in general the elections were transparent, credible, free and fair""."
1,"The government had also noted the SA Observer Mission (SAOM) report which had found that although the election was not adequately free and fair, it should be considered legitimate, the statement said."
1,"In Xinjiang and Tibet, ""the situation there is very good"" said foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao."
1,"""If there are problems out there it is the issue of separatists who want to undermine the situation, and a very important issue is the East Turkestan terrorists and the Dalai Lama separatist clique,"" he told a press briefing."
1,"""I adopt a two pronged approach."
1,"Robinson said that among other issues she would bring up was the ""widespread"" problem of torture in China."
1,"Afterwards, answering questions alongside co-signatory Vice Foreign Minister Wang Guangya, she made it clear measures to crack down on terrorism should not be used to justify rights abuses."
1,"She specifically highlighted the situation of the ethnic Uighhur Muslim population of Xinjiang, China's furthest west region, where rights groups have claimed a crackdown against separatists has been stepped up since the September 11 attacks on the United States."
1,"Analysts have warned that however tough Robinson's talk, international attention is probably too firmly focused on the anti-terror coalition, of which China is a part, to place much pressure on Beijing over human rights."
1,"In anti-terror campaigns, ""there must also be very clear boundaries and I am worried specifically about the Uighur population in Xinjiang, I am worried about the situation in areas like Tibet for example, which I wish to raise,"" she said."
1,"BEIJING, Nov 8 (AFP) - United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson began a visit to China on Thursday with a warning to her hosts not to use the war against terror as an excuse for repression."
1,"However despite previous discussions ""I haven\'t had as much progress on individual cases as I have wished to,"" she added."
0,"Robinson, who is due to attend discussions on human rights education and meet President Jiang Zemin during her two-day trip, began the visit by signing an agreement between the UN and China on further cooperation in human rights dialogue during 2002."
1,"China has repeatedly said it is ""a victim of terrorism"" in Xinjiang, which borders Afghanistan, and there have been reports of Uighur activists being rounded up following the September 11 attacks."
1,"One is to encourage this cooperation and the other is to express concerns about serious situations of human rights violations or shortcomings, that I will also do."""
1,"That the fight against Xinjiang ""terrorists"" was part of the global anti-terror battle ""should be very clear, no double standards should be pursued here,"" he added."
0,"I do this in each country that I visit,"" she said."
1,China later denied there were abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet and said the real issue was separatists -- Uighurs who want an independent state of East Turkestan and Tibetans associated with the Dalai Lama -- taking advantage of the international crisis.
1,"Any cooperation with China over rights issues would not blunt further criticism, she pledged."
1,"Robinson told reporters in Beijing she would raise individual cases of prisoners as well as her concerns about the ""widespread"" use of torture in China and the treatment of people in the regions of Tibet and Xinjiang."
1,"""I will also raise some individual cases and express concerns."
1,"The former Irish president said she was concerned at ""a worrying trend in a number of countries to use the excuse of combating terrorism to clamp down on freedom of expression and legitimate dissent which is not violent""."
1,"The cycle of reoccupation-withdrawal-reoccupation is part of this approach, which is no secret to anyone."
1,"It is also working to push the Palestinians and the world into new labyrinths and tunnels, inside the old tunnels, to distract them from the main and central demands."
1,The only way to peace lies in the full Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories that were occupied in 1967 and the termination of the occupational and settlement presence in these territories.
1,"The reoccupation was a kind of collective punishment for the inhabitants of those cities and the villages around them, villages that constitute an organic and vital extension of the cities."
1,The Israeli withdrawal was a correction of a mistake the Israeli Government made when it decided to reoccupy parts of the main West Bank cities following the assassination of Israeli minister Rehav'am Ze'evi.
0,"After their withdrawal from Bethlehem, Bayt Jala, and Qalqilya, the Israeli forces withdrew from Ramallah yesterday, but they maintained the siege and closure around the city."
1,It is also reflected in the fact that the ruling Israeli coalition has no agreed-upon political plan and that the settlement plans and initiatives that are attributed to this Israeli official or that are unable to meet the minimum legitimate Palestinian demands.
1,No other people in the world have seen such suffering.
1,"This means that the suffering of the citizens in Ramallah, like the suffering of the citizens in Bethlehem, Bayt Jala, and Qalqilya, will continue on the roadblocks, affecting their medical, economic, educational, and social life."
1,"That showed that the ruling right-wing coalition in Israel is pursuing an occupational policy and is not, in the first place, willing to recognize the firm national Palestinian rights to freedom, independence, and the end of occupation and settlement."
1,The way to peace does not lie in devious methods to circumvent the inalienable Palestinian rights.
1,Such methods would only complicate things and add fuel to the raging fire.
1,In its approach to the national Palestinian rights the Israeli Government is playing the cat and mouse game.
1,"This policy, which disregards the need to establish a just peace based on the need for the Palestinian people to regain their freedom and independence, is reflected in statements made by the Israeli officials, who brag about the large number of Palestinians who were killed or arrested by the Israeli forces."
0,"The Israeli forces destroyed buildings and installations in those cities, arrested dozens of citizens, and killed dozens others."
1,It is trying to use the time factor to perpetuate the occupation.
1,The main and perhaps only reason for this suffering is the continuing Israeli occupation and its heavy burden on Palestinian citizens.
1,"These initiatives and plans largely try to keep as much hegemony and as many settlements as possible on Palestinian lands, resources, airspace, and crossing points."
0,"The Kyoto Protocol, which was signed four years ago, provides for a 5.2% reduction in the emission of polluting gases by industrial states in 2008-2012, compared with the 1990 level."
0,The Czech Republic is the first country of the Visegrad group to have completed the ratification process.
1,"Prague -- The UN has confirmed to the Czech Republic the successful ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, the aim of which is to ensure the reduction of the so-called greenhouse gases, Environment Minister Milos Kuzvart told the participants in a UN conference on climatic changes in the Moroccan city of Marrakech yesterday."
1,This policy is supposed to guarantee Israel's security?
1,"The house arrest, temporarily relaxed only after massive international pressure, imposed by Israel's prime minister on Yasir Arafat follows the siege of the Palestinian president's headquarters by Israeli troops."
1,"Sharon, who as defense minister in 1982 headed the Israeli Lebanon invasion, at that time -- as was determined by Israel's Supreme Court -- shared responsibility for the massacres in the Palestinian Sabra and Shatila refugee camps and therefore lost his government post in 1983."
1,"Sharon, who back then caused serious damage to Israel's international reputation, is well on his way to doing so again."
1,It must be clear to all who want peace that it is time for a different policy.
1,"1 What kind of victory is it that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon thinks he is achieving with his ""total war""?"
1,"The last few months have shown that his strategy of suppression has not prevented further suicide attacks, which [attacks] must be emphatically condemned in the strongest terms."
1,"A lasting solution to the conflict can only be achieved with the principle of ""land for peace"" determined at the Madrid Conference in 1991."
1,"A few days ago the Israeli prime minister himself referred to the Lebanon war, and in so doing voiced his regret that Palestinian leader Arafat was not killed by Israel at that time."
1,"In Israel, 338 who refuse conscription are a sign that increasingly more Israelis feel they are held hostage by 250,000 settlers and are not prepared to go to war for the settlements."
1,"On the contrary, it prepares the ground for further hatred and a further escalation of the violence."
1,"In return for recognition of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state, Israel's right to security from its neighbors must be guaranteed."
1,"International journalists are being refused access to the cities occupied by Israel, a group of Arab and Israeli peace activists, who wanted to bring food to Ramallah, is expelled by the Israeli Army."
1,Militarily Israel can win the war against the Palestinians because of its strength; politically -- in the eyes of the world's public -- it looks different.
1,Israel must -- as was demanded by the United Nations -- withdraw from the occupied territories; international peacekeeping forces should be deployed.
1,"With his campaign against Palestine Sharon is jeopardizing relations with the Arab states, whose peace offer (Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah's peace plan) he has just turned down."
1,All who want peace must be aware that the material basis for a security guarantee for Israel will only be supplied with the withdrawal of all settlers and soldiers from the areas occupied in 1967.
1,"After occupying the autonomous Palestinian city of Ramallah, Israeli tanks are pushing further into the Palestinian autonomous areas, occupying other cities and destroying the established -- EU-supported -- infrastructure."
1,"In this context everyone must be aware that the core of the problem is still the illegally established Israeli settlements in the Palestinian autonomous regions, which have steadily been expanded in the last few years."
1,"Unimpressed by UN decisions and EU appeals, Sharon is continuing his policy of provocation, which began with his demonstrative visit to the Temple Mount."
1,The question arises for the Israeli Labor Party of how long it can still justify a coalition with Sharon.
1,"Russia favours creation of ""international instruments"" to regulate emissions"
1,"Russia is ""interested in creating international instruments for regulating emissions, which will guarantee the stable economic development of all signatories to international agreements on the climate sphere without any exceptions"", the statement reads."
1,"Moscow, 16 July: The Russian Foreign Ministry has called for ""taking into account Russia\'s specific interests"" in working out international documents concerning the regulation of emissions."
1,"""The US decision to withdraw from introducing state measures to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases negatively affects the world community\'s efforts to ensure the global and efficient character of the Kyoto protocol,"" the document reads."
1,"A Foreign Ministry statement in connection with the opening of a conference of the signatories to the UN framework convention on climate change in Bonn reads that taking into account Russia\'s interests ""is of vital importance from the viewpoint of prospects for the ratification of the Kyoto protocol inside the state""."

0,According to the timetable a short-term space expedition to the International Space Station is scheduled for lift of for April 25.
0,The launch of a direct-TV telecommunication spacecraft by a Russian booster rocket Proton is tentatively slated for April 28.

1,"Presidents Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo, sensing outright isolation of Mugabe and the refusal by many Zimbabweans and the West to recognise his win, have dispatched African National Congress secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe and prominent West African diplomat Adebayo Adedeji to try to hammer a compromise between ZANU PF and the MDC."
1,The two envoys met MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai on Thursday and Saturday last week and outlined their brief and how they intended to proceed in trying to break the impasse.
1,Others say ZANU PF only wants the MDC on board to facilitate international recognition and the financing of its economic recovery programme and land reforms.
1,"They also met the top leadership of ZANU PF, which included national chairman John Nkomo and administration secretary Emmerson Mnangagwa, both heavily tipped to become vice presidents and possible successors to Mugabe."
0,"Mbeki, Obasanjo envoys in fresh bid to save Mugabe"
1,"According to sources, the two Zimbabwean political parties were asked to draw up agendas for talks as the first step to finding a compromise to the current crisis."
1,Diplomatic sources say African leaders are frantically making efforts to bring the MDC on board through the formation of a coalition government in order to facilitate recognition of the Zimbabwean government by the international community and unlock much-needed foreign aid that has been suspended.
1,The MDC has said it wants fresh elections conducted under international supervision by the United Nations within the shortest possible period.
1,"The 54-nation Commonwealth, the 15-nation European Union and most of the former Eastern Bloc states, the United States, the Scandinavian countries and most Western states and Japan have refused to recognise Mugabe's re-election saying it was a blatant fraud and marred by state-sponsored violence."
1,It is also believed that some hardliners in ZANU PF want the current treason charges against Tsvangirai to be used as a bargaining chip to arm-twist the MDC leader into a compromise with Mugabe.
1,ZANU PF however wants the MDC to accept the result of the presidential election and join it in a coalition government whose composition is not yet clear.
1,The sources said the formation of a coalition government being pushed by Mbeki and Obasanjo was the most ideal way to stave off international isolation of Zimbabwe but has been received with mixed feelings by the governing party.
0,Mbeki and Obasanjo have given the duo three weeks to come up with a solution that will help bridge the rift between the two political parties and arrest the deteriorating political and economic crisis in the country.
1,AFRICAN superpowers South Africa and Nigeria this week stepped up efforts to broker a comprise between Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to ward off the crisis of illegitimacy facing controversially elected President Robert Mugabe's new administration.
1,"The MDC has also refused to recognise Mugabe's re-election, saying the March 9-11 vote was massively rigged and thousands of its supporters denied the vote."
1,"Mugabe has received support from regional leaders as well as Nigeria, Russia, Iran and China."
1,"The government should take urgent measures to prevent and cure HIV and AIDS, he said."
0,"MOSCOW. May 15 (Interfax) - As of today, 194,000 HIV cases have been registered in Russia, Federal AIDS Center director Vadim Pokrovsky said at an Interfax press conference on Wednesday."
1,"Otherwise, the surging epidemic could turn into ""a national security threat,"" he said."
1,"People become ill in seven or eight years, therefore, doctors cannot monitor all who have contracted the infection,"" he said."
0,"The number of HIV cases totaled around 177,000 in December 2001, Pokrovsky said."
0,"Thus, HIV cases are up by 17,000, he said."
1,"Furthermore, ""HIV develops over a very long period of time."
1,"In these covenants, the companies pledge to rank among the world leaders in energy efficiency by 2012."
0,"Following the formal ratification of the Kyoto protocol by all the parliaments of the concerned countries, that protocol will become equivalent to a Belgian law."
1,But it is highly unclear whether these measures will lead to many extra reductions of emissions in comparison with the business as usual scenario without additional policy efforts.
0,"If it were to emerge from the comparison with domestic and foreign companies that certain companies do not rank among the world leaders in energy efficiency, they would have to present a plan to achieve the highest energy efficiency on time (by 2012)."
1,Hence a broad social debate on who should contribute how much to realizing the Kyoto standards is urgently necessary.
1,Thus the benchmark covenants could be reconciled with the European Commission's recent proposals for launching a unified market for European carbon dioxide emissions by 2005.
1,We readily accept that there are good intentions on the part of both the government and this country's various sectors to comply with the Kyoto standards.
1,"However, no broad social debate has yet been conducted on the crucial question: How much should each sector or target group contribute to achieving the Belgian Kyoto standard?"
1,Companies are urged in the proposed covenants to adopt measures which have an economic cost recovery period of less than five years or have an internal rate of return greater than that of a straight-lined obligation.
0,"Within the framework of that protocol, Belgium must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5 percent, compared to 1990, in the 2008-2012 period."
1,"However, taking into account these external climate costs is essential, because the users of energy-intensive goods are confronted in that way with the consequences of their choice of product."
1,"To begin with, the principle of benchmarking itself raises questions."
0,Fourth is the contrast between the benchmark covenants' relative emissions standards and the Belgian Government's absolute restrictions on emissions within the framework of the Kyoto protocol.
1,This European proposal assumes absolute restrictions on emissions (companies obtain rights to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide) and is hence irreconcilable at first sight with the Flemish benchmark covenants.
1,A cost-efficient division of efforts implies that each sector must limit its emissions to the point at which the additional costs for one extra ton of reduction are the same in all sectors.
1,"According to industry, relocation, with the resulting job losses, would be the only solution."
1,But benchmarking is not sufficient from the viewpoint of economic efficiency (realizing the Kyoto restrictions on emissions at the lowest possible costs for the whole of society).
1,This implies -- whether or not one agrees with it -- that the Kyoto protocol will become binding for all of this country's inhabitants and institutions.
0,"In return for their commitment, they are exempted from additional (Flemish) emission restrictions, taxes on emissions, or negotiable emission rights."
1,Belgian industry is advocating benchmark covenants because it is afraid that an absolute limit would weaken considerably its competitive position with respect to similar companies in regions where the Kyoto protocol is not ratified.
1,The great advantage of negotiable emission rights in that the system can lead to a cost-efficient division of effort among all sectors and target groups.
1,"Companies could be allocated rights on the basis of an energy efficiency standard, on the condition that they are prepared to accept an absolute emissions ceiling."
1,"Since industry does not wish to let itself be pinned down on an absolute emissions ceiling, while the government feels itself committed to an absolute ceiling, industry is foisting the necessary efforts onto other sectors in society through the benchmark covenants."
1,"However, the benchmark covenants could be opportune here for settling the initial allocation of emission rights."
1,"However, this disregards the fact that arguments other than purely financial ones also play a part in the location decisions of companies in our region (favorable location near seaports, availability of know-how, well-educated personnel, stable political climate...)."
1,"That is strikingly illustrated by Belgian large-scale industry, which has made great efforts over the past 10 years, over which energy intensity (energy use per unit of final product) has improved considerably."
0,"In a nutshell, benchmarking means that companies compare their energy efficiency with that of similar plants abroad."
1,"By using the benchmark covenants to allocate emission rights initially, the good points of covenants are retained and their drawbacks are eliminated."
1,"Thus the benchmark covenants could have very significant consequences for other sectors and target groups in our society, whereas the latter are not involved in the deliberations on those covenants."
0,The federal and local authorities are currently preparing the ratification of the Kyoto international protocol on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases.
1,"If industrial greenhouse gas emissions increase considerably over the next 10 years, that will have to be offset by a commensurate reduction of emissions in the transport sector, services, households, and so forth."
1,Large-scale industry wishes to counter the expected rise with so-called benchmark covenants.
0,"In that way, less energy-intensive products enjoy a relative advantage."
1,"Despite these shortcomings, we believe that a role is reserved for the instrument of benchmark covenants."
1,"As a result, the costs of additional restrictions on emissions in industry must be compared with those of other sectors, such as the transport sector, households, the service sector, and so forth."
0,"Third, questions can be asked about the emission restrictions that would be achieved by the covenants."
1,"Second, benchmark covenants do not guarantee that the external climate costs of energy use (the increased greenhouse effect caused by the burning of fossil fuels) are correctly taken into account in the final products of the sectors concerned."
1,"Benchmarking guarantees only that companies belong to the top of their class, but says nothing about that class's performance as compared with the whole universe."
1,Only a division that takes account of every sector's possibilities and is borne by the various target groups guarantees that Belgium will achieve its Kyoto aims without draconian measures having to be adopted at the eleventh hour.
1,"In any case, it is high time that a social debate be organized on the division of effort to achieve the Kyoto aims."
1,"But a very considerable increase in production is expected in Belgium over the next 10 years, so that (even with very efficient processes) overall carbon dioxide emissions will certainly rise."
1,Those covenants contain insufficient guarantees in themselves to achieve the Belgian/Flemish reduction targets in an economically efficient manner.
1,"Because this debate has failed to take place, it is understandable that all sectors (ranging from processing and manufacturing industrial sector, the electricity sector, the tertiary sector, and the transport sector to the residential sector) are currently doing their utmost to make their own future efforts as small (yet acceptable) as possible."
0,"However, if they wish to emit more (because, for instance, their output is increasing considerably), they can do so provided that they purchase the necessary emission rights from companies which have a surplus of rights."
1,"Nonetheless, he will be made to realize that he cannot command the CDU, that his power base lies in Munich and not in Berlin, and that the invitation of kingmakers to accept the crown comes at a cost."
1,"The government is floundering, more seriously than anyone would have thought six months ago."
1,"Certainly, Mr. Stoiber has done everything in his power to spare himself the fate of his mentor, Franz Josef Strauss."
1,"But it was the uncertainty with which her rival, Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber of the Christian Social Union, the CDU's Bavarian sister party, also shrouded himself that made the question of who would lead the Union parties into the 22 September elections as chancellor candidate against incumbent Gerhard Schroeder, so exciting."
1,Mr. Stoiber seized it once the CDU made clear that it preferred him to its own chairwoman.
1,"Mr. Stoiber has come a long way from his refusal to sacrifice himself for the CDU in an election that once looked impossible to win, through his statement that he would under no circumstances run against the wishes of Ms. Merkel and her party, to his willingness to take her on in a divisive vote if necessary."
1,The CDU chose him because it believes in victory.
1,"Mr. Stoiber carefully tread the path to the candidacy, spurred on by many and reined in by others"
1,"Rather than force himself on the CDU, he waited to be called."
1,"If anyone in their ranks can turn this to their advantage, it is Mr. Stoiber."
1,That has always been the basic premise for a CSU chairman to accept the candidacy on behalf of the bigger sister party.
1,"Nor will Mr. Stoiber have any illusions of what it means to lead an election campaign, although he can be confident in the knowledge that what is at stake is not Edmund Stoiber, nor the Union, but Germany as a whole."
1,The Union parties could not have wished for a better situation from which to launch their campaign.
1,The most cogent argument in Mr. Stoiber's favor is that he will be running as a hopeful and not as the ticket of last resort.
1,"That Angela Merkel, the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union, wanted the job had long been an open secret, although no one but she knew how far she was prepared to go."
1,"Having marginalized their own leader, the CDU grandees cannot afford to leave the chancellor candidate in the lurch as well."
1,"But he let slip the opportunities to turn back, because the forces that drive him -- his desire to affect change, his sense of duty to his peers and his ambition -- would not permit him to pass up the biggest chance of his political life."
1,"It does not, of course, guarantee success at the polls -- or even solidarity in the campaign."

1,"In terms of market, the Mexican exports do not play an important role, but the support for OPEC on the part of Mexico, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia in 1998 and 1999 lent credibility to the policy of cutbacks, and achieved the recovery of prices."

1,"Nevertheless, according to the researcher from the UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] Economics Department, Angel de la Vega, since the Fox administration does not have the security of a fiscal reform available, it cannot be ruled out that Mexico might collaborate with OPEC in the event of a more serious reduction in oil prices."

1,Some diplomats raise questions about her priorities.
1,THE ABDUCTION of a French diplomat's wife on Thursday has introduced a political dimension to the kidnap-for-ransom pestilence that has spread dramatically during the past 10 months.
1,"But the seizure of the diplomat's wife and her driver was the first time in 10 years that the gangs struck at members of the diplomatic community, whose immunity has been somehow respected by organized syndicates."
0,"Ang-See's close collaboration with former PNP chief, now Sen. Panfilo Lacson, is an open secret."
1,"They think she is travelling too much, while internal problems sap the country's energy, and that she has misplaced strategic priorities in her overseas visits."
1,"The reasoning behind this perception is that if the gangs were after ransom money, it did not matter whether their victims belonged to the diplomatic community."
1,"Some administration officials wonder whether she paints doomsday scenarios just to embarrass the administration and to portray the contrast in performance between the PNP under Lacson and the current PNP leadership, which has no love lost with Lacson."
0,Then President Joseph Estrada had to cancel visits to Paris and other European capitals in 2000 after he was told that he would receive a hostile reception from the European public over the lengthy impasse of negotiations for the hostages' release.
1,"We don't need al-Qaida terrorist attacks in this country to bring the government down in turmoil, create uncertainties in the business community, and frighten tourists and investors away."
1,She has more dangerous enemies at home than elsewhere.
1,"While Ang-See's statistics, derived mainly from non-official sources, paint a grim picture, they should not be ignored."
0,"On the way, a group of about six armed men in uniforms blocked her brand-new car (which had no diplomatic plate) at Better Living Subdivision, Paranaque, and boarded it."
0,The gunmen let her go.
1,"The abduction, however, delivered a more devastating blow on the capacity of the Macapagal administration to crack down on kidnap syndicates than the grim statistics trotted out by Teresita Ang-See, the Chinese-Filipino anti-crime ""crusader,"" who has relished the role of Cassandra to the Philippine National Police under the new administration."
1,"Since 1992 when organized crime became a leading preoccupation in the national agenda, the main victims of the predatory syndicates have been Ang-See's compatriots in the Chinese-Filipino community."
1,"The PNP, which believes it was a case of mistaken identity, could not explain why it took the gang two hours to know the identity of the lady."
1,"At the same time, the PNP can't be burying its head in the sand and offering explanations all the time, rather than check the rise of kidnappings."
0,"From my own sources in the diplomatic community, as well as in the Philippine National Police, the diplomat's wife and her driver went to the French school in Bicutan at around 10 a.m., in response to a call from school authorities who reported that her son had some accident."
0,The gang drove the car around the vicinity while they interrogated the victims for about two hours.
1,There is a strong perception in the diplomatic community that the abduction was a fake kidnap-for- ransom and was a political act to demonstrate the administration's incapacity to put crime under control.
1,"The diplomatic community's perception of President Macapagal is that she is organized, knows her economics, does her homework, and has been unscathed by scandals that have been rubbed on her skin by a scandal-mongering opposition."
1,Her hoses have to be directed at internal terrorism.
0,The kidnap gang freed her and her driver within two hours of seizure.
1,"A number of embassies here, including the American, French, German and Japanese, have issued advisories to their nationals warning them of risks when travelling in some parts of the country."
1,"At the rate syndicates are abducting targets--regardless of their ethnic identity and their diplomatic status--with impunity, the administration faces a more serious and direct challenge to its capacity to govern from the specter of lawlessness than from the daunting problem of sparking an economic recovery amid the global economic downturn."
0,"The gang fled with the car, and the victims took a tricycle home."
1,"Since the members of the diplomatic community had previously been immune from the predatory attacks of the gang, the abduction of the diplomat's wife naturally has generated anxieties among foreign governments about how safe their diplomats are in this country."
0,They did not take her ring and other pieces of jewelry.
1,"Whether the incident was plain holdup, as the PNP would like to see it, the abduction reinforced the growing perception in the diplomatic community and foreign governments that there is a breakdown in law and order and that the Macapagal administration is not in control."
1,The seizure sent alarm bells ringing in the diplomatic community in this country.
1,The advisories have been prompted by domestic lawlessness and political turbulence rather than by a possible outbreak of insidious terrorist attacks associated with al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden and provoked by the American military action in Afghanistan.
0,"After detaining them for about two hours, they drove her and the driver to a squatters' area and dropped them off near the Bicutan exit, but not before they took her necklace and wallet."
1,"The fire is raging at home, these sources say, not in the United States, China, Japan or Afghanistan."
0,"The Abu Sayyaf kidnapping of foreigners in Sipadan, Malaysia, and in Dos Palmas, Palawan, broke this ethnicity pattern."
1,The details of the crime and the swift release are less important than the political implications.
1,The hijackers asked them for money--one million pesos was mentioned--which she had supposedly withdrawn from the bank.
1,"The conventional explanation is that because of their wealth, they are the logical prey from which to extract ransom money--a perverse form of nationalist racism and redistribution of national wealth."
0,She told them she had not withdrawn such money and that she was the wife of a senior French diplomat.
1,"The repercussions in the home governments and countries are as damaging as the prolonged hostage-taking by the Abu Sayyaf of French, German, Malaysian, Lebanese and Finnish nationals during the Estrada administration."
1,But the downside is that the deterioration of peace and order is her nemesis that is undoing all her diplomatic initiatives in the world stage to project the Philippines as a staunch ally in the US-led coalition in the war on international terrorism.
1,The perception is that there was a political message in the abductions staged by some groups that are determined to make this government fail.
1,"This perception is also fueled by the crime statistics of Ang-See, who represents the pessimistic outlook in contrast to the more dismissive outlook of the PNP whose statistics are less alarming than those of Ang-See."
1,"She said during the U.S. President Bush's working visit to China last month, state leaders of both countries agreed that Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Hu Jintao would visit the United States this year."

1,Zhang replied that Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing has put forward China's stand on the matter while making strong representations to the U.S. government with the hope that the United States treats the matter seriousness it deserves.
1,Zhu said the U.S. side should stop interfering in China's internal affairs by interfering in the Taiwan issue.
1,"China hopes the United States will not do anything against the spirit of the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques, she said."
1,"The question of Taiwan, which relates to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, is an essential and most important issue and is at the heart of Sino-U.S. relations, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue."

1,Lebanese officials have avoided publicly commenting on the new message from Washington.
1,"According to the sources, US fears were based on Israeli information about such a likelihood."
1,"But the sources reaffirmed that Lebanon remained committed to its position regarding the situation on the border, where violations of the UN\'s so-called ""Blue Line"" are usually committed by Israel."
1,"""It is Israel that is responsible for all kinds of provocative activities,"" one official source remarked, referring in particular to air raids and other aggressive acts against Lebanon."
1,The sources said an American message was delivered to the Foreign Ministry on Friday regarding the Bush administration's claims that Hizbullah was contemplating a new military operation to mark the anniversary of the assassination of then-Hizbullah secretary-general Abbas Mussawi.
1,"According to a government official in contact with US politicians recently, hostility toward Hizbullah has grown tremendously in recent months within the US administration."
0,"Mussawi was killed on Feb. 17, 1992, when an Israeli helicopter fired a missile into his car in the South."
1,"Lebanese authorities expect the United States to curb such Israeli infractions, the official source added, rather than adopt Israeli claims and seek security for the Jewish state."
0,"Security sources said that Israel had reinforced security measures along the Lebanese-Israeli border over the past couple of days, having adopted a series of ""precautionary procedures."""
0,"For that purpose, Israeli troops were deployed en masse along the border over the last 48 hours, the security sources said."
1,The official did not rule out the possibility of seeing such animosity reflect negatively on relations with Lebanon and Syria - and on the region in general - on the eve of the Arab summit scheduled for March in Beirut.
1,"Washington has expressed concern to the Lebanese authorities about the possibility of a Hizbullah attack against Israel within the next couple of days, and requested that efforts be deployed to prevent such a development, official sources disclosed Friday."

1,The shabby conduct by the US President Bush is nothing but revealing before the world each and every one of his political immaturity and moral corruption.
1,We have thus actively contributed to the preservation of global peace and security.
1,Good and evil are two completely contradictory concepts.
1,"Through this, the United States is aiming to move away from the political and economic crisis that it is currently suffering from and continue to realize the policy of hegemony."
1,"Recently, US President Bush, in the State of the Union address he gave before Congress, recklessly picked on our country, saying we develop and possess weapons of mass destruction [WMD]."
1,The real ringleader of evil and the base of evil is the United States.
1,"In reality, the United States is truly a country that has no qualifications and face to take issue with other countries by saying that they are an evil and so on."
1,"As we all know, our Republic is currently exerting every effort possible for peace on and reunification of the Korean peninsula and for the world's peace and security."
1,"As soon as the New Year set in, he proclaimed this year as a year of a war and then poured all kinds of abusive words against our Republic."
1,It is also a remarkable measure for safeguarding peace and security on the Korean peninsula.
1,This is truly a very despicable act.
1,"Just like those who enjoy fire are bound to die by being burnt, the only thing that will be left to war maniacs like Bush, who tries to find a way out of a crisis through aggression and war, is a bitter destruction."
1,"It convened a joint meeting by the Republic's government and political parties and organizations and announced the three appeals and three proposals, which reflect the entire nation's unanimous desire and will."
1,Manifest examples are the following facts.
1,"As can be seen from the aforementioned, there is no real evidence either to link our Republic to terrorism or to designate as an evil country."
1,What a brazen-faced deception of reality and unbearable insult to a sovereign state!
1,Anything that goes against this can be said to be evil.
1,"Nevertheless, Bush is impertinently picking a quarrel regarding our Republic by saying this and that and viciously spoke ill of the DPRK."
1,"Despite all of this, however, US President Bush linked our country to terrorism by force and spewed out virulent remarks that our country is threatening the world's peace."
1,"They are posing a grave threat to the world's peace and security, blabbing about the establishment of an invasive missile defense system."
1,"He then spewed out all kinds of vicious remarks, picking on a few countries, which included our country, as countries that destroy so-called peace of the United States and the world and that we are part of an axis of evil."
1,This is the fairest and the most realistic and patriotic manifestation for opening a decisive breakthrough in the achievement of the fatherland's reunification cause this year at all costs by the united efforts of our nation under the banner of the 15 June North-South Joint Declaration.
1,Our Republic is currently making every possible effort to reclaim national sovereignty by reunifying the fatherland as soon as possible and safeguard peace and security on the Korean peninsula and of Northeast Asia.
1,"In the current international community, promoting peace and stability, safeguarding a country and nation's sovereignty, and protecting people's lives and properties are good."
1,"In the meantime, our Republic's government has shown our principled position on terrorism on several occasions in accordance with the trend of the international community's opposition to terrorism."
1,Our heroic People's Army and people will never tolerate the US imperialists' reckless military oppressive attempt and will pose a merciless annihilating blow to the aggressors.
1,Herein lies his wicked intention.
1,"Our Republic is also fiercely waging a fight against war or the exercise of military force in resolving international issues and is seeking ways to combat terrorism, and the international community is praising these efforts."
1,"This markedly reveals [the United States'] extremely dangerous attempt to link our Republic to terrorism by force and crush us at all costs with military strength and is no more than showing, to the international community, Bush to be the most vicious war maniac himself."
1,"It is to provoke an aggressive war opposing countries that they are not satisfied with, in particular the DPRK, and crush those countries through military strength."
1,What we cannot condone more than anything is that Bush arbitrarily designated our country as part of a so-called an axis of evil.
0,We have signed and joined anti-terrorist treaties such as International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.
1,"Over the recent 10 years alone, the US imperialists perpetrated open [word indistinct] state-level terrorism against sovereign states, such as Iraq and Yugoslavia, with preposterous reasons and pretexts."
1,"However, Bush is greatly miscalculating."
1,"Despite the powerful compulsions it is apparently labouring under, Islamabad should at least seek details of the Pakistanis being held at Guantanamo Bay, so that their cases can be taken up with Washington later."
1,"Incidentally, another 325 Pakistanis are currently rotting in Afghan jails."
1,"No figure has been provided by Washington nor demanded by Islamabad, but a fairly large number of these dehumanised detainees are believed to be Pakistanis."
1,"Secretary Rumsfeld has justified the atrocious conditions by resorting to verbal quibbling by designating them as 'unlawful combatants' or 'battlefield detainees', to avoid giving them PoW status under the Geneva Conventions."
1,"A proactive approach, for once, is called for."
1,"Unlike Pakistan, these governments have at least gone to the trouble of finding out how many of their citizens, no matter how misguided, are being held."
1,"If the US is willing to allow their repatriation back home to stand trial under Pakistani laws, why is Pakistan so coy about exercising this option?"
1,Human rights groups have also condemned this grave violation of the Geneva Conventions.
1,It should at least take up its own citizens' plight with the Karzai administration.
1,Pakistan has pledged $100 million for Afghan reconstruction.
1,The guilt or otherwise of these detainees can be determined only by a competent court.
1,"TV footage has shown hooded and shackled prisoners in steel cages, reminiscent more of Nazi concentration camps than a civilised detention facility."
1,"Saudi Arabia, France and even Britain have protested over the inhuman treatment, and demanded repatriation of their nationals."
1,"In this case also, Islamabad is pretending they do not exist."
1,The USA itself admits that one of the possible fates of these prisoners is to stand trial in competent courts in their own countries.
1,"There are now 158 al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners held in eight-by-six-foot open-air steel cages at the US naval base of Guantanamo Bay, while another 270 are in the custody of US forces in Afghanistan."
1,Islamabad's silence does not set a healthy precedent.
1,"They too are likely to be flown to similar camps sooner or later, though their shifting has been put on hold in the face of deep international outrage at the way Washington is treating these prisoners."
1,"Yet, the least that Mr. Bush should have done is to prove his accusations of a collusive nexus among Iran and Iraq, two Islamic countries, and North Korea, arguably a reclusive `Stalinist\' state, besides their alleged ""terrorist"" accomplices."
1,"While Iraq and North Korea tend to see America\'s new game plan as an extension of its characteristic policy of ""hegemony"", China is aghast at the ridiculous terminology of America\'s new thinking and its unexplained logical basis."
1,There is no reason to cavil at the universal consensus against terrorism on the international stage.
1,"By raising this new political bogey in the specific context of the present US-led international ""campaign"" against terrorism and by aggressively harping on such ideas at a Republican caucus on February 1, Mr. Bush has left little or no room for doubt about his real foreign policy intentions."
1,"In a macro-perspective, it appears that Mr. Bush has chosen to raise this new specter so as to promote his pet theme of a space-age missile defense system for America and its allies."
1,"By provoking Iran at this sensitive stage in the global ""campaign"" against terror, Mr. Bush has inadvertently encouraged the protagonists of a prospective ""clash of civilizations"", a controversial thesis that underlines the religious divide."
1,It is in this climate of an impassioned American campaign against new phobias that some powers like China have joined the chorus of protest by the three countries named by Mr. Bush.
1,"Given Mr. Bush\'s objections to the suspected Iranian plans of acquiring WMDs, Ayatollah Khamenei is critical of America\'s archetypal ""sales of lethal weapons"" to Israel and others."
1,"At the micro-level, though, the US President has obviously counted on his country's several different disputes with Iran, Iraq and North Korea over time."
1,"Iran\'s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has described the US itself as ""the greatest evil""."
1,"The defining characteristic of the presumptive ""axis of evil"" is portrayed as a tendency on the part of its constituent states and non-state players to acquire weapons of mass destruction [WMDs]."
1,Clearly at this point there is no cause for the international community to support American efforts to widen the campaign beyond Afghanistan.
1,"As for Teheran specifically, its defiant view of America's expanding strategic-military presence in Iran's neighborhood at this juncture may have weighed with Mr. Bush."
1,"In his State of the Union address to the US lawmakers on January 29, Mr. Bush categorically identified Iran, as also Iraq and North Korea, besides their ""terrorist allies"" as a functional anti-US entity and as a collective ""axis of evil"" in the global arena."
1,"In the event, the dynamics of an emerging Iran-US tussle will determine his actions against the ""axis""."
1,"This may, in part, explain why he clubbed two Islamic states with a religion!"
1,"What is more, Mr. Bush has already begun articulating a policy designed to ""prevent"" such ""outlaw regimes"" and their ""terrorist"" cohorts from ""threatening America"" and its ""friends and allies""."
1,The communicative compulsions of dancing to the tunes of evocative sound bytes cannot adequately explain Mr. Bush's failure to substantiate this theme during his internationally televised address.
1,"However, it has been left to Iran\'s President, Mohammad Khatami, to reaffirm Teheran\'s sustainable advocacy of a ""dialogue among civilizations"" as the cultured answer to the ""insults"" that Mr. Bush has now heaped upon the Iranian people."
1,"The arrogance that marked the latest Manichaean pronouncement of the US President, George W. Bush, alleging an ""axis of evil"" on the international stage has justifiably produced a backlash of adverse reactions."
1,"His denunciation of Iran, in particular, is a case that illustrates Washington's urge to underline America's supposed pre-eminence as the only superpower in history with a universal jurisdiction."
0,The diplomat traveled in the company of his colleagues from several EU countries on board a special military flight.
1,It would only be in a later stage that Belgium could imagine providing assistance to the person who claims to be one of its citizens.
1,"Like other European countries, Belgium sent on Sunday [3 Feb] a diplomat to Guantanamo to verify the identity of a detainee who claims to have Belgian nationality."
0,This is a naturalized person who originated in a country of northern Africa.
1,"The United States indeed is rejecting the idea that its prisoners, to whom it denies the status of prisoners of war, should receive consular support reserved for prisoners of common law."
0,A high Belgian diplomat posted to the United States left Washington on Sunday to go to the American base at Gauntanamo in Cuba where 158 Taliban who were captured during the military operations in Afghanistan are being held.
1,"Among the prisons, whose conditions of transport and detention continue to arouse controversy, there are several citizens of European countries, or those claiming to be such."
1,Meanwhile the United States is raising the volume in the matter of the struggle against terrorism.
0,"However, this paper was told Sunday by the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Brussels that the diplomat sent to Guantanamo, who is supposed to stay at camp X-ray until Tuesday, also has the task of learning about the detention conditions of the ""Belgian Taliban"" or both."
1,A detail indeed shows American defiance as to European approaches: the army tried to impose an elevated price for the trip of the diplomats from Washington... [passage omitted]
1,One of the detainees has claimed Belgian nationality.
1,"This paper was told that Belgium expressed a certain amount of impatience with the American authorities after it learned, as did other European countries, that Great Britain and France have already been able to send a verification mission."
1,But what type of assistance?
1,"""The United States Are Prepared To Fight Terrorism Alone"""
1,The priority for Belgium is to verify the identity of the detainee who claims its nationality.
1,"However, George Bush is not about to change his rhetoric."
1,"He again urged these countries to ""clean their own homes."""
1,"""The United States will not allow the world\'s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the most destructive weapons."
1,"""In the antiterrorist struggle, as far as I am concerned there is black and white, and no shades of gray,"" he said Thursday 31 January during an election campaign visit to Atlanta, Georgia, and to Daytona beach, Florida."
1,"His force of conviction when he preaches the struggle of good against evil largely explains his exceptional popularity ratings (83 percent of favorable opinions, according to the latest ABC and Washington Post surveys.)"
1,He is clearly more comfortable in this role than he is in he management of routine matters.
1,"George Bush has succeeded not only in returning the war to the front pages of the newspapers, ousting the Enron affair and the budget deficit, but also in forcing the Democratic opposition to unite against the enemy."
1,So on Tuesday evening George Bush tried to reproduce the tone of his 20 September speech in order to galvanize the country.
1,"The condemnation of the ""axis of evil"" comprising Iran, Iraq, and North Korea was applauded by Republican and Democrat hawks, and barely challenged by a few foreign relations experts."
1,"As for responses abroad, in order to make them somewhat less sharp, the administration has introduced some qualifications."
1,"""If you are one of the countries that develops mass destruction weapons, and you are willing to ally with a terrorist group, or you currently support terrorism, or if you do not sincerely share the values precious to us, then you too will be under surveillance,"" he said."
1,"CNN\'s Bill Bennett called it ""a speech of moral strength."""
1,"This is to re-mobilize the country behind the war on terrorism and to prevent Americans, by returning to a more normal life, from concerning themselves chiefly with the daily repercussions of the Enron affair and rising unemployment."
1,"White House spokesman Ari Fleischer even added that the expression ""axis of evil"" was not used in an allusion to the notorious Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis."
1,The unanimous opinion of the media is that he was successful in this.
1,"According to the Washington Post , ""the President\'s intensity was equal to the need to pursue the war."""
1,"Be that as it may, the aim pursued by the White House seems to have been achieved."
1,"The pursuit of the war on terrorism has given Americans a new illustration of his character and his confidence in the country\'s leadership,"" the New York Times said."
1,"""The rest of the world needs to be with us, because such weapons can be targeted on them as well as on us."""
1,"""Solid and often eloquent remarks,"" CBS\' Ran Rather said."
1,"The evil is real, and it must be combated... even in the midst of tragedy, specially in the midst of tragedy, God is there..."""
1,"Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, and Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader in the Senate, have attempted the impossible feat of ""setting partisan attitudes aside and supporting our President 100 percent in the war on terrorism,"" while at the same time trying to criticize economic and social policy."
1,New York -- The warlike tone of the State of the Union speech delivered by George Bush Tuesday evening has prompted responses as critical abroad as they are enthusiastic in the United States.
1,"In his fellow countrymen's eyes, the test constituted by 11 September has revealed George Bush's talents as a war leader."
1,"His speech was ""brilliant, full of strength and eloquence."
1,"According to Fox\'s Juan Williams, ""the words came straight from the heart."""
1,"Whatever the cost of our country's defense, we will pay it."
1,Television commentaries were even more full of praise.
0,"This, among other things, by specifying that no military operations are planned against any of the three countries cited."
1,The President said he was confident about the US allies' support against countries trying to acquire mass destruction weapons.
1,"The White House spokesman announced the night before last that the Taleban prisoners being held in Guantanamo will enjoy the treatment envisaged under the Geneva Convention, but not the foreign prisoners from Al-Qai'dah, who the Bush administration considers terrorists."
1,"Spanish daily blasts ""meaningless"" US announcement on Guantanamo detainees"
1,It can only be paradoxical that a supposedly model democracy like the USA can trample on the law to such an extent.
1,"That may be the case, but even the worst criminals have the right to a lawyer and to know the charges against them."
1,Donald Rumsfeld and other senior Washington officials have tried to justify what is happening in Guantanamo on the grounds that the detainees are dangerous terrorists.
1,"Nobody in the US government has answered this question, even though international organizations like the Red Cross and Human Rights Watch have denounced the defenceless situation of these prisoners, who have no access to lawyers and do not enjoy the minimum guarantees for judicial proceedings which, in their case, do not exist."
1,"If they don't enjoy the advantages of being prisoners of war and do not have the right to be tried under US criminal law, what jurisdiction will be used for these men being held incommunicado in a place that isn't the USA or Cuba?"
1,"The key issue is not so much whether they are treated humanely and their beliefs respected, but their legal status."
1,"So when the White House says it is going to treat the Taleban in accordance with the Geneva Convention, it is pure rhetoric, nothing other than a public relations exercise and will be meaningless in practice."
1,"The USA refuses to admit that these detainees are prisoners of war because, under the Convention, they would have the right not to answer any questions except to give their name and rank, they could not be tried except for war crimes and they would have to be repatriated after the war ends."
1,"Bush's spokesman added that none of the 158 detainees in Guantanamo is going to be given prisoner-of-war status, which makes the apparently positive part of the White House statement meaningless."
0,"The Geneva Convention is the international treaty signed in 1949 by the USA and other countries, which regulates the treatment of prisoners of war and grants them a set of legal and humanitarian rights."
1,"The world well remembers how the United States has been calling other countries as violators of human rights, while it has been involved in one of the grossest type of human rights violations."
1,After pointing its finger of blame at tens of regimes and governments around the world for decades.
1,"He said that the Americans are treating these prisoners like ""an ostrich""."
1,"The US President George W. Bush has said that he does not recognize the detainees in Guantanamo military base as war captives, and hence he will not accord them the rights and privileges that they would automatically get under Geneva Convention."
1,"Washington needs to review its own history of crimes against humanity, especially the non-WASP humanity."
1,The world is watching how the US is treating the detainees in Guantanamo.
1,What is non-WASP humanity?
1,"(John Walker, ""the American Taleban"" has not been taken to Guantanamo because he is not part of the non-WASP humanity)."
1,The treatment of Al-Qa'idah and Taleban prisoners will go down in history as the most shameful detentions in the history of post-war incarceration in the 21st century.
1,"The point is that if the United States keeps pontificating and preaching about human rights, it can't suddenly forget about its past lectures to other countries and nations."
1,"Addressing Friday worshippers gathered at Tehran University, Iran's former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday criticized the treatment of Taleban and Al-Qa'idah prisoners in Guantanamo military base in Cuba."
1,"The former president and current chairman of the Expediency Council said that these prisoners are put in chain, in cages in summer and in winter."
1,"An international tribunal consisting of experts on international law should decide on this issue, not Mr. Bush whose knowledge of international law leaves plenty to be desired."
1,"If the United States is truly committed to human rights, it should show it in its treatment of the detainees that it has transported in chain to another side of the globe."
1,"According to Americans, this sort of humanity does not qualify for any of the laws that have been legislated by international organizations, by any accepted world conventions."
1,"They neither believe that these prisoners are truly prisoners, nor do they believe that they are ""captives."""
1,"[Headline of editorial] By Adbolhassan Sobhani ""Pot Calling the Kettle Black"""
1,Non-White Anglo-Saxon-Protestant humanity is that part of humanity whose eyes are not bluest of the blue and whose hair is not blondest of the blonde.
1,"This is in no way defending the Taleban or the Al-Qa'idah members, some of whom might be guilty of the most heinous crimes against the poor oppressed people in Afghanistan."
1,The argument by Bush is that these detainees are members of a terrorist group and hence they do not qualify as members of a defeated country or an army.
1,The case of the United States is like the case of that pot who called the kettle black.
1,"Even if we assume that George W. Bush has a point in making this argument, it is not up to him to decide who is a captive or who is not a captive."

1,"However, Mugabe is under strong regional pressure to form a government of national unity, incorporating his closest rival in the poll, to ensure political and economic stability in Zimbabwe."

1,The European Union (EU) and the US have joined the opposition in alleging the election was neither free nor fair and threatened more sanctions on Zimbabwe.

1,"""I, Robert Gabriel Mugabe do swear that I will be faithful to the laws of the Republic of Zimbabwe, so help me God,"" said Mugabe who was flanked by first lady Grace."

1,"As bad as the prospects of change seem to be at this juncture, I don't believe fresh efforts are doomed to failure."
1,"The campaign has been successful so far, and has not been seriously challenged by Arab and Muslim Americans who have been struggling to merely distance themselves from terrorism."
1,Complete disregard for the plight of the Palestinians despite timid warnings to Israel to show restraint is indicative of the new political perspective.
1,The early signs of the newly-shaped American perception of their conflict with Arabs and Muslims have started to surface.
1,I have to say that Americans are not innately biased against Arabs and Muslims.
1,"Although it is difficult to imagine that the American foreign policy towards Arab issues could become worse than what it has been, my sense is that it will be much more difficult to argue the Arab viewpoint in the American decision-making quarters."
1,There is need for a partnership between Arab and Muslim governments and existing Arab and Muslim communities in the United States to counterbalance the anti-Arab and anti-Muslim forces in America.
1,The attack on the World Trade Centre was particularly disheartening to a fledgling Arab and Muslim American community that had made a tremendous amount of progress in introducing Arabs and Muslims as legitimate political constituents on the American political scene.
1,The Arab and Muslim communities in the United States have made a great progress without considerable support from the Arab and Muslim governments.
1,"The attacks have been a great gift to pro-Israel groups in America, as well as Israel."
1,"If the attack on the World Trade Centre was intended to be a warning to America to abandon its anti-Arab policies, the warning was not heeded."
1,Supporting our schools and community centres is a good starting point.
1,"Indeed, American foreign policy towards the Arab and Muslim worlds was not much better before Sept. 11, but since then tactful political manoeuvring has given way to forthright disregard for the Arab viewpoint."
1,"However, like any other legitimate message, it costs money, sustained effort, and organisation to put it out."
1,Many people are enthusiastic about a new Arab-American relationship that is based on mutual respect and understanding.
1,The notion of a right-wing Zionist state ardently propelled by right-wing America is a dream come true for pro-Israel groups.
1,"Since the attacks, I have had a chance to speak to many Americans who have no grasp of the Arab viewpoint."
1,I believe much more can be accomplished if closer attention is paid to the potential for change from within America.
1,Many people here are not happy with the influence that small pressure groups have on their foreign policy.
1,A strong case can be made for change in the American foreign policy at the grassroots level.
1,"The American society is a dynamic, changing one that can be swayed if presented with the right message on a consistent basis."
1,Whatever little leverage the Arab countries used to have to moderate the American foreign policy bias has but disappeared.
1,"Soon after the World Trade Centre attacks, we started to witness the beginning of a concerted effort by the Bush administration and the media to cast Arabs and Muslims as the new enemy of America."
1,It was once hoped that a well-organised Arab and Muslim community in the United States could curb the attacks on Arabs and Muslims in the media and start to do what Arab and Muslim governments had not done by injecting the Arab viewpoint into the American political discourse.
1,The attacks have accomplished for the Bush administration and Israel what no political or social force within America has ever been able to accomplish in recent memory.
1,This is only the beginning of a new Arab-American relationship.

1,"Caving in to the international pressure, the United States pretended to support the creation of an independent Palestinian state."
1,The prospect for the settlement of the Middle East issue is still bleak due to those who stand in the way of the settlement.
1,"However, this is no reason to be optimistic about the situation."
0,"On 17 November, Israeli troops pulled out of Tulkarm, a West Bank area of the Jordan River."
0,"In September last year Israeli Prime Minister Sharon, the then leader of the opposition party, visited a holy place in Kuds [Jerusalem], throwing Israel and Palestine into a fierce fight."
1,The clash between Israel and Palestine briefly appeared to be abating in the wake of the large-scale attack incident [taesupkyok sakon] against the United States.
1,"Today, in order to find a correct solution to the Middle East issue, it is important to frustrate Israel's territorial ambition and create conditions for Palestine to create an independent state of its own."
1,Israel's scheme is to make Palestine a vassal state and bring it under its control.
1,This is why Israel agreed to discuss the issue of granting independence to Palestine on conditions that Palestine claim only a small piece of territory and waive its right to raise [organize] a regular army.
1,International pressure is on Israel again.
1,It is an urgent matter for Israel to withdraw completely from the occupied land of Palestine.
1,"As such, Israel's territorial ambition is persistent and clever."
1,"On 18 November, the following day Israel began withdrawing its troops from Tulkarm, Israeli troops deliberately gunned down two Palestinians in the Palestinian autonomous areas as if they were quarries."
1,It was in fact due to strong international pressure that Israel began withdrawing its troops from the Palestinian autonomous area.
1,"As a result, the situation has become tense again."
1,"However, it has become fierce again after Israeli minister of tourism was assassinated."
1,"The United States, which is currently waging a war in Afghanistan, tried to shore up support from Arab states and Islamic world through a crafty ruse."
1,"Toward the end of October, Israel declared that it would withdraw from some of the Palestinian autonomous areas where the situation was ""relatively calm"" and pretended to be abiding by the decision."
1,It is also obvious that the aggressive US policy toward the Middle East will remain unchanged.
1,Israel makes itself appear to be withdrawing its troops from some of the occupied Palestinian autonomous areas.
1,The United Nations and many countries around the world began paying attention again to the situation in the Middle East that is becoming more complicated.
1,Sharon's remarks and behavior that were insulting to the Palestinians infuriated Palestine.
1,Israel has never abandoned its aggressive ambitions.
1,"However, it stopped withdrawing its troops halfway through under the pretext of ""unstable situation"" and occupied them again."
1,"Apart from this, we cannot talk about the settlement of the Middle East issue."
1,There is no way of knowing whether or not Israel will halt the withdrawal of its troops again under any pretext as it did before.
0,The US administration is about to call on Israel to support the creation of a Palestinian state with East Kuds as its capital.
1,"Convinced that the United States can never abandon it completely, Israel is dragging its feet on the withdrawal of troops citing a variety of excuses."
1,"The great leader [suryong] Comrade Kim Il-song taught: \n\t\n\t\n ""Imperialism is the source of war and the disturber of peace."""
1,"Commenting on this, many Arab states and international opinion emphatically said that it is nothing more than a political stratagem to win support for its war in Afghanistan and to further expand the sphere of its domination in the Middle East."
1,Israel is adamantly against the creation of a completely independent Palestinian state.
1,"Taking advantage of this, Israel occupied six cities located in the Palestinian autonomous areas by the use of force."
1,"Seeing through the US scheme, Israel refused to continue the troop withdrawal from the Palestinian autonomous area."
1,It is quite obvious that Israel will employ a crafty trick in the future to realize its burning territorial ambition.
1,The desperate fight even took tolls of women and children.
1,"The United States, which has been in the van of invading other countries, is about to put pressure on Israel, not because it is now more sympathetic to Palestine or finds Palestine more tolerable than before, but because of its own national interests."
1,"On 20 November, the Israeli army bulldozed dwelling houses in the Palestinian autonomous area and even committed such an atrocious act as wounding Palestinians without hesitation."

0,This is the first test case for WTO.
1,The Kyoto Protocol rejection by the US is in effect a hidden subsidy.
1,This is a breach of the very constitution of WTO.
1,He said Greenpeace looked forward to work in partnership with developing countries to get the proper assessment of the impact of the WTO instead of a new round of trade negotiations.
1,"Then today, in Doha, they must condemn the US for allowing a hidden subsidy, which according to the US governments own figures is equivalent to between $76.7bn and $300bn by 2010."

1,"If in six days time there has been no new round, this meeting will have been a success, because it will force the WTO to change, he said."
1,This is the only responsible course of action and it will be a historic success for Doha and we want this meeting to be a success.
1,"Parmentier, however, did not say categorically that there would be street demonstrations."
1,"Earlier, the Rainbow Warrior sailed into Doha on Thursday morning, to challenge the WTO to use the 4th ministerial conference to force the United States to commit to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change."
0,The organisation will also be broadcasting No New Round Radio daily over the Internet.
1,Parmentier urged the delegates not to even discuss the possibility of a new round of trade negotiations unless the US this week in Doha ratifies the Kyoto Protocol.
1,"Answering another question, he said the WTO came to Qatar to hide from protestors."
0,The US produces 25% of world green house gases but has only 4% of the population of the world.
1,"Islands will go under, nations will vanish from the face of earth and millions of people will have to leave their homes."
1,"You know us, said Remi Parmentier, the political director of Greenpeace International."
1,"Parmentier said, on the one hand, the WTO claims to support sustainable development and environmental protection and on the other, it does virtually nothing to protect the environment."
1,"But, he added that the Greenpeace is here to voice the concerns of millions of people."
1,Parmentier hoped the Qatari authorities would honour their commitment to allow free access to the people of the country to the ship and vice versa.
1,"In 1993, when the WTO was created everybody jumped without checking whether there was a proper safety net at the bottom."
1,Parmentier said they would use every possible peaceful means at our disposal to make sure that the voice of the people is heard.
1,"What we are saying is, lets not jump again too quickly and lets check if there is a safety net."
1,"He pointed out that Qatar, while presenting Dohas candidature to host the meeting, had made an official commitment that it would allow peaceful protests."
1,It just cannot be that one country reaps all the benefits of mock globalisation but does not take any responsibility for the biggest global problem we are facing today.
1,And thats the meaning of the Rainbow Warrior being here.
1,"He was responding to a question from Gulf Times whether there would be demonstrations during the WTO ministerial meeting, which opened in Doha yesterday."
1,And the people who are here are going to voice their concerns and voice their demands.
1,"WTO decisions must not be allowed to overrule international environmental agreements; the precautionary principle must be incorporated in decision-making, and patents on life must be banned, Parmentier added"
1,"Talking to the press, Greenpeace executive director Gerd Leipold said currently the most important issue is climate change."
1,"If we continue to burn fossil fuel at the rate we are going today, we look at a bleak future."

1,OPEC is due to hold a meeting in Vienna on Wednesday to discuss the widely expected production cut.
1,"United Nations, New York, Nov 11, IRNA -- President Mohammad Khatami and his Venezuelan counterpart Hugo Chavez here Saturday cited cooperation among OPEC member countries as the key to forestalling further oil price declines."
0,Khatami is currently in New York to attend a special session of the UN General Assembly on 'Dialogue Among Civilizations' to have an international convention on the theme approved.
1,"Khatami, who had met with Chavez on the sidelines of a UN General Assembly session, also explained the ongoing Afghan crisis in the wake of the US-led strikes as well as the Islamic Republic's stance on the September 11 terror attacks in Washington and New York."
1,He also described cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC countries as a boost to their national interests.
1,"Chavez voiced ""the Latin American concern"" on the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, saying Caracas was following the international stance on the fight against terrorism, violence and intrigues."
1,"He also called for further expansion of bilateral cooperation between Tehran and Caracas in various international fields, such as OPEC and the Group of 77 (G77) of the world developing countries."
1,"The Iranian president also hailed Chavez's recent efforts in travelling to OPEC and non-OPEC member countries, in a bid to garner support for propping up the sagging crude prices."
1,"The United Nations designated 2001, as the Year of 'Dialogue among Civilizations' on President Khatami's initiative."
1,"He reiterated his call for a global peace coalition, based on justice, to stem the roots of terrorism."
1,"""Forming a world-wide coalition based on peace and justice to eradicate the ominous phenomenon of terrorism is a must,"" Khatami said."
1,"Chavez, whose country currently heads the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said that Venezuela's recent efforts in the form of his whirlwind trips to OPEC and non-OPEC member countries, were in line with the interests of all the oil producing countries."
1,"Barring any reversal to the trend, the weekly quoted U.S. magazine Business Weekly as saying that Beijing might bring the island to its knees without firing one bullet."
1,"Paris, July 11 (CNA) -- Taiwan's economy will become totally dependent on mainland China within the next few years, causing the island to lose control of its own political fate, a French weekly warned Thursday."
1,"The Nouvel Observateur said that Beijing is unlikely to annex Taiwan by force, despite its deployment of missiles along its coastal provinces opposite Taiwan, but is instead resorting to smarter tactics, bringing the Taiwan authorities to heel through Taiwan businessmen who are eager to explore the mainland Chinese market."
1,"Although there is only scant possibility of a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the Nouvel Observateur said, Beijing\'s military buildup in its southern coastal provinces still makes the region ""the most heavily armed place in the world next only to the Middle East,"" and a dangerous flashpoint in the 21st century."
1,"The weekly said that mainland China has attracted more than US$50 billion in investment from Taiwan thus far, while the Taipei authorities bowed to pressure from its own businessmen to lift restrictions on investment in mainland China in May, a move expected to speed up the flow of Taiwan capital to its arch rival."
1,"But Beijing's leaders are not likely to blink on the issue either because an independent state in Taiwan would boost the schisms in Tibet and Xinjiang and threaten the regime in Beijing, the magazine claimed."
1,"The publication quoted Wu Guoguang, a professor at Hong Kong University, as saying that any concessions by Washington on the Taiwan issue could trigger a defection of its Asian allies, including Japan, to Beijing's fold."
1,"Another factor which might deter Beijing\'s military adventurism in the Taiwan Strait is Washington\'s ""readiness to fight Beijing for Taiwan,"" which will bear witness to Washington\'s determination to remain a power in Asia, according to the magazine."
1,"The highway to the stars is looking radiant for the Belgian ""cosmonaut."""
1,"In several weeks, he learned the indispensable bases of the Russian language."
1,"""This should insure that we can recover the sums involved, that in the prospect of another space trip."" One million euros will be devoted to this ""cancellation"" insurance."
1,"""This assessment confirms us in our choices,"" a delighted Ylieff said."
0,Several avenues have been explored to collect the overall amount.
1,"This is a first on a ""TMA,"" which attests to the confidence the Russian and European partners have put in him."
1,The SSTC's overall budget will not suffer from this.
0,"""Budgets will remain constant,"" explained Eric Beka, the SSTC\'s secretary general."
0,"So he will be the second most qualified crew member on board, behind the on-board comander, who still needs to be appointed by the Russian space authorities."
1,He is making appreciable efforts to meet the other foreign cosmonauts who are in training there and share his experiences.
1,"The latest, and also undoubtedly the most logical, is internal to the SSTC, the federal Scientific, Technical, and Cultural Services, which, in particular, manage the country's space budgets."
1,He will become one of the best elements in the corps of European astronauts.
0,That was with the US Atlantis shuttle.
0,"The document, a letter sent to both the ESA (European Space Agency, to which Frank De Winne currently reports) and the Russian Rosaviacosmos space agency, guaranteed the payment by Belgium of the expenses tied to this space trip."
1,This is an amount that Belgian yesterday pledged to pay to Russia.
1,"As Picque emphasized, ""for many years, each franc invested by Belgium in space has brought in three francs."""
0,"The formal agreement regarding Frank De Winne's flight with the Russians was signed in Brussels on Thursday by Charles Picque, the Minister for Science Policy, and his government commissioner Yvan Ylieff."
0,An initial segment of 2.5 million euros (Frank's training costs) will reportedly be paid in the next few days.
0,The sums obtained will result from the assignment of a portion of the space budget to this mission (and its many related scientific fall-outs) rather than to other optional programs.
1,"In addition, he will carry the projects of Belgian scientists and industrialists active in the space sector far."
1,"As is known, Frank De Winne's taxi flight lasting about 10 days comes with a price tax: some 600 million [Belgian] francs (15.5 million euros)."
1,"On Thursday [29 November] the Belgian Government formally committed itself, vis-a-vis its Russian and European partners (the European Space Agency [ESA]), to pay Frank De Winne's ticket into space."
1,"People there are really unanimous about him,"" she told us."
0,"So, if that should prove necessary, De Winne will be able to personally pilot the space ship."
1,"And his ""parachute"" too."
0,"For 10 days, the second Belgian astronaut will get to the International Space Station [ISS] on board the brand new Russian Soyuz TMA-1 space ship."
0,On it Frank De Winne will serve as the on-board engineer.
1,His dynamism is an asset.
1,It will be a mission that will be rich in promises.
0,Cancellation Insurance
1,Who said that space investments were not interesting?
0,"In a word, De Winne's ticket into space has been financed."
0,De Winne will thus qualify technically in space piloting.
0,"About 10 years ago, Dirk Frimout was the first Belgian astronaut to go into earth orbit."
0,It is a ship that is more modern and bigger than the current Soyuzes.
1,Nor will the space sector's in particular.
1,"""Since there is no other Belgian astronaut at the ESA who is capable of replacing Frank De Winne for this mission if it suddenly proved impossible for him to carry it out, we are also expecting to take out \'travel insurance\' for our \'cosmonaut,\'"" Yvan Ylieff also said."
0,"So on 4 November 2002, that is to say, in a little less than one year, the second Belgian to reach space will take off from the Baikonor cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on board a brand new Soyuz space ship: the TMA-1."
0,In a few weeks the second Belgian to go up there will don a Russian cosmonaut's space suit.
0,The sum in question will come from the SSTC's space budgets and be deducted in several years (two or three).
1,"""Frank worked at Star City with much intensity."
1,This appointment is not expected for a few weeks.
0,Some Particularly Financial Choices
1,"In Brussels on Wednesday [28 November], the French astronaut Claudie Haignere, who had just completed a flight in space together with the Russians that in every way was identical to the one scheduled for De Winne, could not find enough praise for our fellow citizen, with whom she trained for several months in Moscow."
1,"The rest of the city was reported to be calm however, with some schools reopening and authorities anxiously awaiting the arrival of a mediation team from the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)."
0,"On Monday, 80 Libyan soldiers disembarked from an Antonov transport plane carrying military equipment, an African diplomat said."
0,"On Tuesday, Bozize was still holed up in his Bangui residence."
0,"Libyan forces helped prop up Patasse at the time, and 100 soldiers have since remained in his presidential guard."
0,Defense and security ministers were dismissed in August.
0,Bozize was fired last month as part of moves by Bangui to close security loopholes which became evident after the abortive putsch.
1,"The country has been on edge since last May when mutinous soldiers attempted to overthrow Patasse, unleashing 10 days of fighting in the capital that left dozens of people dead and displaced thousands."
1,"The shooting began after soldiers tried to arrest Bozize, a former close ally of Patasse who had been army chief since 1996, in connection with large amounts of weapons discovered in the city, amid suspicions of an attack in preparation."
1,"BANGUI, Nov 6 (AFP) - Gunfire broke out for a fifth day Tuesday in the capital of the Central African Republic, after Libyan military reinforcements were flown in to help government forces end a standoff by soldiers loyal to an ousted army chief."
1,The crisis in the Central African Republic began late Friday after soldiers loyal to sacked chief of army staff Francois Bozize exchanged gunfire with presidential guard units and government troops.
0,"Shooting was heard in northern Bangui and near the airport in a neighborhood inhabited by officials in President Ange Felix Patasse's government, an AFP correspondent said."
1,"This tactic is no more than an improved carbon copy of the style of ""divide and rule."""
1,"Talking about it and about its possible use are several months old and, more exactly, they have been going on since the Israeli Government headed by Ari'el Sharon came to power about nine months ago."
1,The core of the matter lies in a just and acceptable political framework that Israel is supposed to approve and participate in to put a final end to the occupation and to the settlement construction activities.
1,It is not implementing an immediate and total withdrawal -- as demanded by the international community as a whole and the United States in particular -- but a phased and partial withdrawal.
1,Such a political framework would lay the firm foundations for a comprehensive peace based on justice and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people.
1,The inevitable result of this tactic -- if it succeeds in temporarily calming down the situation -- is that it will take back conditions to their former state of tension after the withdrawals are completed from all the Palestinian cities.
1,"This being the case, it would be better for both Israel and the Palestinians to have an immediate and parallel Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied parts of several Palestinian cities."
1,"Israel says that it carried out this tactic in Bethlehem and Bayt Jala, or so it claims, and yesterday, it claimed that it carried out the same tactic in Qalqiliyah when the Palestinian security forces returned to the three centers that had been re-occupied by the invading Israeli forces."
1,"Only such an immediate and parallel withdrawal would expedite the return to serious negotiations between the two sides based on the reference point of ending the occupation, ending settlement construction activities, and restoring the full inalienable rights of the Palestinian people."
1,The facts show that this Israeli tactic is new only in execution.
1,"These days, the Israeli government is adopting a relatively new tactic regarding its plan to withdraw from the Palestinian cities and towns that it had re-occupied more than three weeks ago."
1,It actually reflects Israel's determination not to deal with the Palestinian issue as one united and indivisible whole.
1,Israel seems to think that this tactic will circumvent the Palestinian move toward independence and will put an end to the Palestinian intifadah by surrounding the areas of tension and dealing with them separately.
1,Only such a peace can bring security and stability to all the parties without exception.
1,The core of the matter is not in the method that Israel is using to crush the Palestinian moves and confiscate the will of the Palestinian people for liberation and independence.
0,It does not leave any city or town except after reaching what it calls a security agreement with the Palestinian side for a cease-fire in that particular city or town.
0,The Israeli press and other media outlets point out that future withdrawals from the cities parts of which are still under Israeli occupation will be carried out in accordance to this tactic of phased and partial withdrawal.
1,"The Israeli Government hopes that this tactic would eventually lead to an integrated and total agreement when all its parts are put together to form a map of ""cantons"" that Israel envisions for the occupied Palestinian lands."

1,"Annan said, without specifically mentioning the US: ""You can not divide the world between the good and the evil, because between them there are shades of gray."""
1,The expression is undoubtedly strong and well thought out.
1,"Nevertheless, the White House's offensive also has a domestic dimension."
1,"America has not seen such a bellicose president since Ronald Reagan, who, in 1983, referred to the Soviet Union as the ""evil empire""."

1,Colin Powell will have trouble wriggling out of the need to explain and justify the president's vision.
1,The USA has proclaimed the right to attack countries which do not cooperate in a campaign that the president has said is taking place between civilization and barbarity.
1,"Until then, it is not certain that the USA will attack Iraq, Iran or North Korea, but the concept of the ""axis of evil"" will surely be on the president\'s lips for some time."
1,George W. Bush is no master of eloquence and his speeches are extremely well prepared.
1,Bush is launching a new budget deficit era: it would be easier for him to sell his proposals under a period of belt-tightening and national security concerns.
1,In some European capitals there are rumours that Bush is defining his doctrine based on the war against terror but also as an excuse to pursue another unilateral offensive.
1,"It sounds clumsy to place North Korea, Iran and Iraq in the same axis as if they were Nazi Germany, Hirohito's Japan and Mussolini's Italy."
1,It was surely not just rhetoric.
1,"The Democrats continue to close ranks behind the president on the war against terrorism, and to mention an ""axis of evil"" could help strengthen an atmosphere of national unity that would suit the president when he announces other points in his budget policy with which not everyone might agree."
1,"President Bush is insisting on cutting taxation on corporations and the richest Americans, at the same time as money for social programmes is drying up."
1,"Things may even get better for him in the event of the crisis dragging on until 2004, when he will probably try to be re-elected."

1,"First, the voter registration process was not transparent and was conducted in such a way as to favour the ruling party."
1,"Third, it is alleged that some key election officials such as presiding officers were Central Intelligence Organisation operatives."
1,"The main reason for this lack of transparency is that in terms of the current constitution and laws, voter registration is conducted by officials appointed by, and answerable to, the President."
0,"In other countries, this process is handled by an Independent Electoral Commission which is an impartial body and whose independence is guaranteed by the constitution."
1,He has used the current constitution to stay in power.
1,A core of determined and committed Zimbabweans is sufficient for this purpose.
1,"If Mugabe were to announce his retirement before the expiry of his six-year term and ZANU PF were to field any of his less illustrious colleagues as a presidential candidate, without a fundamental change to the rules, Zimbabweans will learn an even more bitter lesson: ZANU PF will ""steal"" that election again."
1,"The conclusion to be reached from this whole picture is that under the current constitutional and legal framework for the holding of presidential elections, it is almost impossible to vote out an incumbent President."
1,IT will be a monumental tragedy for Zimbabwe and the future of the democratisation process if we fail to draw proper and useful lessons from the debacle surrounding the just-concluded presidential election.
1,It is him who must be confronted with such a demand as constitutional reform.
0,"The tripartite elections contributed to what ultimately became a ""low"" turnout in Harare."
1,Mass action for a new constitution places Mugabe in a difficult situation.
1,The masses required for such a struggle to succeed need not be substantial.
0,"This was done by officials appointed by, and answerable to, Mugabe."
1,I must warn at the outset that there are two groups of persons whose analyses must be handled with caution.
1,These two points are crucial in any discussion of the way forward.
1,Constitutional reform is at the heart of any new democratic discourse in Zimbabwe.
1,"More fundamentally, the struggle for a new constitution is a question of principle, not personalities."
1,The issue is not about Mugabe.
1,A criticism which has been levelled against this way forward is that mass action aimed at confronting Mugabe with a demand for a new constitution translates into recognising him when in fact his government is illegitimate.
1,"My view then, and indeed those of my colleagues, was that a democratic environment in which free and fair elections are the norm, and in which citizens enjoy real freedoms, could only be created if a new, democratic and people-driven constitution were put in place."
1,This enabled the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation to abuse its position by broadcasting ZANU PF propaganda only.
0,Our constitution does not specifically provide for political rights such as free and equal campaigning platforms for competing political parties.
0,"After the Supreme Court nullified the General Laws Amendment Act, the President used his powers to reinstate most of its provisions through a statutory instrument."
1,We have learnt our lesson and it will be irresponsible to seek to dispute this clear fact.
1,We do not need to wait for that scenario before we embrace the need to fight for a new constitution.
1,Mugabe must be forced to yield to a new process of constitutional reform leading to a new constitution.
1,"Secondly, the designation of polling stations, as is now well known, was specifically done in a way that favoured ZANU PF by granting ridiculously few polling stations in urban areas."
0,- Lovemore Madhuku is task force chairperson of the National Constitutional Assembly and a lecturer in law at the University of Zimbabwe.
1,Yet I must declare my interests at the outset.
1,I now proceed to illustrate this truth.
1,Never again should Zimbabweans go into an election under the current constitution.
1,Mugabe must be confronted with constitution issue
1,"It is a legitimate struggle which Mugabe cannot dismiss as a Western imperialist ploy because its demands are clear and unambiguous: a more democratic system of government, a more democratic framework for conducting elections, an expanded Bill of Rights and so on."
1,"However, this says nothing about the way forward."
0,An Independent Electoral Commission appoints professional election officials.
1,"It was naive for the Movement for Democratic Change to believe that the people's anger against Mugabe was, in itself, sufficient to carry the day in an election, whatever the circumstances."
1,"First, there has been no spontaneous uprising against Mugabe notwithstanding the widespread disbelief that greeted his victory among many voters, particularly those in urban areas."
1,"The NCA last December completed a draft constitution which Mugabe, through Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa, refused to receive."
1,"And in doing this, he overrode court orders to the contrary."
1,"Thus, it was the President who banned postal voting by all Zimbabweans outside their constituencies except members of the army and the police."
1,"He cannot be heard to defend the current constitution, which has been roundly condemned by all."
1,There must be mass action for a new constitution.
0,A fresh election must be held within 90 days.
1,That draft must be forced on Mugabe and the NCA hopes that Zimbabweans will join in this noble cause to put in place a secure framework for good governance in Zimbabwe.
1,This much must be regarded as admitting of no doubt.
0,"The second group is that of ""winning"" and ""losing"" politicians."
1,It is critical that a new constitution be in place as soon as possible so that any future election is held in a transparent and credible manner.
1,"In terms of that view, it is almost impossible to change the government through an election conducted in terms of the current constitution."
1,It was the President who directed that there be tripartite elections in Harare.
0,"Under the current constitution, the President has no powers to designate a successor, should he decide to retire."
1,Mugabe is a political fact.
1,A presidential election is not necessarily six years away.
1,"If such rights had been enshrined, it would have given the opposition the right to approach the courts for orders directing the police to facilitate free campaigning in the so-called no-go areas."
1,There is little doubt that the presidential election was neither free nor fair.
1,"ZANU PF had anticipated such an uprising, hence the massive intimidatory show of force that was evident in the deployment of security forces in every part of the country during and after the announcement of the election results."
1,"From those very first days sometime in early 1997 when, alongside colleagues like Tendai Biti, Welshman Ncube, Brian Kagoro, Priscilla Misihairabwi, Everjoice Win and Tawanda Mutasa, I participated in formulating the concept of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), it has been clear to me that the sole purpose of the current Zimbabwean constitution is to preserve and protect the rule of ZANU PF."
1,"In legal jargon, to those who do not recognise his presidency, he remains the de facto President."
1,This brings us to the way forward.
1,"This election was not stolen on March 9 and 10 2002, nor is the outcome illegitimate merely on the allegations of rigging arising from the events of the polling days."

0,The latter are alleged to have voted for Mugabe.
1,"Secondly, key African countries have accepted Mugabe\'s victory while almost the entire Western world has ""rejected"" the election results."

0,The same situation arises if the President dies while in office.
1,"The lesson to be learnt from this poll is that until Zimbabwe has a genuinely democratic constitution enshrining universally recognised norms and institutions for the holding of an election, a free and fair ballot will remain a mirage."
1,"Politicians who in the run-up to the election peddled theories about how the ""will"" of the people would prevail notwithstanding the labyrinth of constitutional provisions loaded against a free and fair election must now admit that they were wrong."
1,Mugabe has no moral excuse for shooting people merely demanding a new constitution.
0,The ban on monitoring of elections by civic society was also reinstated.
1,"In other countries, there is no scope for such madness."
0,"In other countries, this is done by an Independent Electoral Commission, which is constitutionally enjoined to act impartially."
1,Even the African observers who endorsed Mugabe's re-election have also criticised the constitutional framework governing elections in Zimbabwe.
1,"Finally, and more significantly, the President enjoys enormous powers under the current constitution which he used to further his electoral chances."
1,"Fifth, equal access to the public media is not guaranteed by our constitution."
1,"Various options have been discussed, but the better way forward is to confront the Mugabe regime with the constitutional question."
1,There were other countless examples of the President's use of the powers he enjoys under the current constitution to mould the electoral process in his favour.
1,Most of the problems faced in this election have their roots in the defective nature of our constitutional framework.

1,"The European Union, which is historically and geographically more closer to the Middle East than the United States, had to make a move after the Europeans ran out of patience toward the worsening US stand that supports the Israeli right-wing policies."
1,"Under this plan, the negotiations should focus on a mechanism for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, ending the settlement activity, finding a just solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees, and allowing time to reorganize the Palestinian house from within with a view to achieving democracy and introducing a multi-party system."
1,The European plan is sensible because it calls for setting up a Palestinian state in the territories that were seized in 1967 in line with the international resolutions provided that the Israeli side officially agrees to this move.
1,"Perhaps the most important characteristic of the new European initiative is the fact that it annuls the hardline Israeli-US stand, which rejects any kind of political negotiations unless the violence stops completely."
1,There is no doubt whatsoever that the Palestinian people welcome and support the new European initiative because it is bold and fair and seeks to revive the peace process on realistic and just bases.
1,"The United States pressured the weaker side, the Palestinians, who are under occupation and subjected to repressive Israeli measures, including assassinations, arrests, incursions into cities, demolition of hundreds of homes, and uprooting of thousands of trees."
1,"Spain and France, which were at the forefront, led an intensive media drive to highlight what is actually happening in the Palestinian territories and extricate the peace process from the stalemate."
1,The peace process was deadlocked as a result of the oppressive Israeli military campaign against the Palestinian nationalistic move and Israel's insistence on suspending the political negotiations and focusing on military actions to subjugate the Palestinian people and liquidate their legitimate rights and aspirations.
1,"The United States, which is pleased with Israel, did not see these Israeli practices and instead focused its attention on the Palestinians' reactions that were generated by the Israeli provocations."
1,"This initiative will show whether the United States will give up its complete and blind bias toward Israel in order to achieve a just solution restoring the Palestinian people's legitimate rights and guaranteeing peace, security, and stability for all nations in the region."
1,The Palestinian leadership and President Yasir Arafat welcomed this plan a few weeks ago.
1,This initiative is not partial.
1,The Europeans were in the right when they emphasized that this unrealistic stand brought the peace process to a deadlock and plunged the Palestinians and Israelis into an endless cycle of violence.
1,"It does not turn a blind eye to the Israeli practices, occupation, and settlement activity and dismisses the notion of punishing the wronged Palestinian people who have been deprived of all their national and human rights."
0,"Meanwhile, a European initiative, launched by all the European Union members, gradually began to take shape."
1,"This initiative disapproves of the flimsy pretexts to increase the Palestinians' suffering and encourage the Israeli right-wing stands, which is what the US Administration has been doing lately."

1,"According to the Minister, Mercosur managed, after an ""enormous technical effort,\' something that did not exist in the region two years ago - the harmonization of the statistics of the member countries, Bolivia and Chile, which were not comparable before."
1,"The Minister believes that tension between Brazil and Argentina, resulting from the floating of the real in 1999, will tend to disappear because the neighboring country is opting for a floating exchange rate system."

1,"""A little calm is needed, the ability to look ahead, not let oneself be carried by the difficulties of the moment,"" he emphasizes."
1,"To Malan, however, more important than the harmonization of the parameters and the little Maastricht is the search for convergence of policies in a broader sense - structural, macro and microeconomic ones."
1,"To Caruana, Argentina has to ""create a broad program that generates internal and external stability and discuss it with the IMF."""
1,"According to Malan, ""long marches start with first steps."""

1,"Dollarization is a not very trivial process of negotiation with the country that issues the currency, in this case the dollar, involving complex questions about the role of ultimate lender, the role of the Federal Reserve in the supervision and regulation of the banks in the dollarized country."""
1,"Whoever says that these are small steps is incapable of recognizing the European Union\'s experience,"" the Minister says."

1,"""We do not want to yield on Brazil\'s having its own currency, its regional currency."
1,He suggests the definition of a series of priorities.
1,The Bank of Spain Governor did not want to detail what points Argentina should deal with to expand its program.
1,"According to Malan, the dollarization process is irreversible."
1,"This priority is urgent right now,"" he told participants in the seminar on ""The Euro and Brazil,"" organized by this newspaper."
1,"""We want to keep alight the flame of a single currency in the region in future, even if a distant one,"" but until then, ""there is the job of consolidating the institutions in the political and institutional sphere, of productive restructuring and of modernizing the State"" in six countries - Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia."
0,"Malan noted that as part of the constructive engagement in relation to Argentina, a group of experts spent the day with authorities from that country, recounting their experiences in situations like the one the Argentines are facing."
1,Malan predicts that Argentina will be more competitive when it emerges from the crisis.
1,"According to Malan, another approach is necessary in this period of transition of the Argentine crisis."
1,"Malan defends a different posture: ""to set aside the notion of cynicism, skepticism, that things will not work out,"" and believe, like the Europeans, that there is a future to be built by the Mercosur countries and Chile and Bolivia, the associate members."
1,"Based on this effort of statistical harmonization, we announced, in December 2000, an agreement for basic convergence parameters."

1,"Criticisms of Chavez's governance have been widespread in the democratic world, above all in the past year, in which he has taken to visiting dictators like Castro or Saddam Husayn and writing to terrorists like the famous Carlos, instead of meeting his promises of prosperity and fair shares."
1,The coup misjudged its strength and Carmona remaining in power could have led to a serious division of the armed forces.
1,"Debatable decisions of his have caused a deep social polarization and brought him into confrontation with representative sectors of civil society, against which he used more demagogy than arguments."
1,But the latest events reveal that his popularity had not collapsed.
1,"It may or may not be to the liking of the Western foreign ministries which shared to some extent Washington's pleasure at the ousting of Hugo Chavez, but the course of events in Venezuela has shown that he has the support of the majority of the population, who want him in the presidency, from which he was deposed and in which he was reinstalled by the military in a confused uprising..."
1,"It is time for the former officer to rethink, to set priorities, to understand that the Cuban model no longer works even for Havana, to give up, as he has promised, revanchism and to understand that Venezuela is a Western country where there is no reason for it to be impossible to improve the fate of the Venezuelans and eradicate the eternal scourge of corruption, within a framework comparable to that of the rest of the world."
1,"All of which, incidentally, is something of which Chavez has done very little so far."
1,"The civilian opposition, which in the absence of political parties was organized around the employers' organization and the trade unions, does not come out of it well either."
1,The today revived president will have to tackle the future with different methods.
1,"This possibility and the proliferation of expressions of support for the overthrown leader among the military officers made a change of course advisable, with the forced resignation of Carmona and the even more meteoric period in office of Chavez's vice-president, Diosdado Cabello, who only took up the post in order to give his leader time to reappear."

0,"Military threat persists after events in Venezuela, Spanish daily says"

1,"Dervis stated that Turkey had shown a great economic performance in last 20-25 years, and added that Turkish economy grew by 7-8 percent."
1,I hoped that Turkish and Greek foreign ministers will visit Middle East jointly.

1,The two colonels would not have been acting on their own.
1,Chavez may be a petty-minded populist who had done great damage to his country's economy; but he is also the legitimately elected president of Venezuela.
1,"Yet he throws law, order and legitimacy to the wind when it suits him."
1,Coup making might have been acceptable during the Cold War.
1,The White House is said to be embarrassed by the report.
1,"The record is long and to Washington's eternal discredit: the CIA's attempts to kill Fidel Castro, its involvement in the coups in Guatemala in 1954 and in Chile in 1973."
1,What makes it all the worse at this particular point in time is that it makes a mockery of George Bush's war against international terrorism.
1,"The whiff of scandal and conspiracy is in the air -- and the American media, ever addicted to conspiracy theories, is not going to let it go."
1,"A week ago, after Chavez had been reinstated by his supporters, the White House denied any role in the failed military coup, although it admitted that US officials had met Venezuelan opposition leaders beforehand."
1,"If it turns out to be true that the two US colonels were involved in the failed attempt, there can be no other conclusion."
1,The Clinton era turns out to have been merely an interlude.
1,"It -- and the opposition Democrats, still smarting at his election victory -- will dig for dirt as long it takes."
1,Americans will want to know who exactly is running their country.
1,"With all the horrific news that has been coming out of the occupied territories recently and now the shocking swing to the extreme right in the French presidential elections with its threat to France's ethic and religious minorities, virtually no attention has been paid to the reported discovery that two serving US Army officers were involved in the recent failed coup against Venezuela's president Hugo Chavez."
1,"But they had been told that Chavez, whose friendship with Libya, Iraq and Cuba has angered Washington, should only be replaced by legitimate, constitutional means; the US would not support a coup."
1,The story could have devastating consequence for the Bush administration.
1,This spells serious trouble for Bush.
1,That must rank as the understatement of the year.
1,"The world, he says, has to be involved in the struggle against those who seek to attack and destroy law and order and legitimate government."
1,The involvement of US military personnel in the putsch suggests a return to the old days when the CIA would organize coups and assassinations to further US interests.
1,"Even if it finally turns out that the two colonels were operating without the knowledge and approval of the White House, it will be a disaster for Bush."
1,Any US involvement in the attempt to remove him by force puts Washington firmly on the wrong side of international law.
1,"For the rest of the world, however, the story already confirms the suspicions that the Bush administration is hell-bent on eliminating its enemies by whatever means possible, legal or illegal."
1,"President Clinton had, it was thought, closed the book on such nefarious activities."
1,They must have been under orders -- orders stretching all the way back to the Oval Office.
1,It certainly is not any more.
1,The question now is: Did the White House lie?
1,"After taking the Office of Presidency, Chavez has implemented an independent foreign policy and seemed to be not in step with the United States in many respects."
1,Coup d'etat is an unusual means to seize a country's political power.
1,It is an unpopular means because it goes against the tide of the world today.
1,"In the past, whenever a coup occurred in some Latin American countries, there was always a backdrop of US involvement."
1,"Washington, 17 Apr (Xinhua) -- A farce of coup d'etat was staged in Venezuela recently."
1,"Since the United States ""supports democracy,"" then why did Maurer have that meeting with Rincon?"
1,"To the United States, Iraq's Saddam Regime is a thorn in the eye and flesh which must be removed."
1,"They acknowledged their contacts with leaders of the coalition of opposition factions who took part in the coup, but denied having supported them."
1,The leader of the coup had no sooner warmed the coveted seat than he had to beat a retreat under pressure upon pressure domestically and internationally.
1,This maybe a surprise to many people.
1,"In addition, while the United States is disgusted with the Cuban Government under Castro, the Chavez Government has kept a close relationship with the Cuban Government."
1,"The Pentagon spokesperson Clarke went a step further to explain that US Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary [Rogelio Pardo-] Maurer for Western Hemisphere Affairs met with Venezuelan Armed Forces Supreme Commander and Inspector General Lucas Rincon in December of last year and made it clear to the latter that the United !\nStates ""supports democracy"" and that ""we in no way would support any coups or unconstitutional activity."""
1,"The only guideline determining US rejection or support of the government of a [foreign] country is whether it follows US baton and whether its domestic and foreign policies are in accord with the US ""national interests."""
1,Why didn't the United States inform Venezuela's constitutional government of the coup attempt by Rincon and the others?
1,Probably this is the major reason why the United States is happy to see a change of government in Venezuela.
1,"The US Government\'s first reaction gave much food for thought when it said Venezuela\'s constitutional president Chavez ""had himself to blame"" for the coup."
1,"As the saying goes, when you pull up the turnip, mud comes with it."
1,Hence one can see that it is not to be surprised that the United States chimed in with the Venezuela's coup organizers.
1,"According to US news media, that coup in Venezuela had something to do with the United States."
0,But Chavez in his 2000 visit to some OPEC member states made a stop at Baghdad where he held talks with Saddam.
0,"For every effect, there is a cause."
1,"Just as Venezuela restored its constitutional rule and Chavez was returned to power, the New York Times came up with a shocking story: the US Government and senior military officials were in contact with the Venezuelan coup organizers."
1,Only it was a little too early to get excited.
1,"In recent months, they met with the coup organizers for several times and gave consent to the overthrow of Chavez."
1,"On this matter, ""supporting democracy"" is but a signboard used by the United States."
0,"Faced with the media's reports, the White House and the Pentagon have had to make statements publicly."
1,"By the same token, the coup in Venezuela has incurred widespread condemnation and objection from the international community, including the Latin American states, except the United States."
1,This is far out of tune with the attitude the United States used to take when a coup occurred in other countries.
1,"The Salvadorian president considered that the vote of confidence in the provisional government of Carmona will not have any repercussions in relations between El Salvador and Venezuela, which he described as ""totally normal, we are not worried in that sense""."
1,They criticized Flores for not condemning the rupture of constitutional order in Venezuela.
1,"""There is no international problem, but rather a manipulation of the subject domestically; and once again I want to ask the FMLN that it does not cause damage to this country."
0,"He explained that ""El Salvador took a different position"" from that of other Latin American countries because at the present time it presides over the Permanent Council of the OAS."
1,"He added that the Latin American countries decided to invoke the OAS Democratic Charter, which implies the investigation all the steps that brought a country to a particular point, and not just simply to determine ""if there were a coup d\'etat or not."""
1,"Flores said, in a press conference, that ""there is no reason to apologize"" to President Chavez, as demanded by Salvadoran opposition parties."
1,"Flores maintained that ""this is a position that is not unique to El Salvador; it is the position of all the European countries, it is the position of the United States; this is in our view totally reasonable when so little information is available."""
1,"He indicated that the Democratic Charter is a new instrument ""and implies that the OAS countries members convene a tribunal"" to investigate the case of a country and ""decide whether or not to remove it from the international community of which it is part;"" something that ""is a tremendously serious process""."
0,He reminded (the press) that currently there is an OAS mission in Venezuela with those very objectives.
1,"San Salvador, 17 April (ACAN-EFE) -- Salvadorian President, Francisco Flores, today defended his declaration of support for the interim Venezuelan Government headed by industrialist Pedro Carmona, indicating that the information that he had at the time was that Hugo Chavez had resigned the Presidency."
1,"It is necessary to be loyal to El Salvador,"" Flores concluded."
0,"The commission is headed by Cesar Gaviria, Secretary General of the OAS."
1,"Asked what repercussions an announced visit to Venezuela-by leaders of the opposition party Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN, left wing)-would have for his government, Flores said that ""my concern is that they may be seeking to cause damage to the country."""
1,"And that in trying to hurt me, it ends up causing damage to the country."
1,The FMLN condemned last Friday the actions against the government of Chavez and celebrated his return to the power on Sunday.
1,"""Our position is very clear, our position was that the new authorities had to receive a vote of confidence to lead the Venezuelan process back to the democratic path,"" he stated."
1,"He added ""we understood that if there were a civilian who had committed himself to call for elections he should receive a vote of confidence."""
1,Israel's atrocities are masterminded by high level Israeli officials including Shimon Peres.
1,The world community should not tolerate crimes of war.
1,"The Palestinian people and the entire Arab World are waiting for a proof that international law protects human beings in general regardless of their color, ethnicity and religion."
1,The Israeli government is committing crimes of war against the Palestinians and should be tried by an international tribunal just like the governments of Rwanda and former Yugoslavia.
1,The news leaked from the reoccupied Palestinian cities confirms that Israeli troops have committed dozens of premeditated massacres against the civilian Palestinian population.
1,What happened in Bosnia Herzegovina is being repeated on a larger scale in various parts of the occupied Palestinian territories.
1,It is a crime against humanity.
1,The public opinion in the Arab and Islamic world is following closely what is happening in the occupied Palestinian territories.
1,This carnage is planned and implemented in compliance with decisions from Israeli field marshals.
1,We expect the World Community to take a step toward referring the Israeli criminals of war to the permanent tribunal for war crimes.
1,"We are waiting to see that international laws are not selective and that they are not applied for political, cultural and ideological considerations."
1,People are being killed in masses and buried in collective graves.
0,This tribunal will be responsible for trying war criminals.
1,That's why they declared the reoccupied Palestinian cities closed military areas into which media people are not allowed.
1,An international tribunal for war crimes has been established in Rome and started its works officially last Thursday with the approval of more than 60 countries.
1,This means we will not need a Security Council resolution to establish the tribunal.
1,"It seems that by wielding its authority and exercising dictatorial powers as the world\'s only superpower, the United States is determined to play a front and centre role in the intricate international game of oil prices and the free flow of this all-important strategic product otherwise known as the ""Black Gold""."
1,Venezuela is an important oil producing nation since its oil directly impacts crude prices in international markets.
1,"Evidently, during a phone conversation on Friday Chavez told his daughter that he was forced to resign and accept the army's non-negotiable conditions."
1,"In any event, it is more than apparent that the United States intends to play a conspicuous role and exert increasing pressure as far as the oil issue is concerned."
1,The US had repeatedly asked Chavez and the Venezuelan government to increase the level of their oil output as well as exports.
1,The dethroning of Chavez by the Americans is a message that disobeying Uncle Sam would have cataclysmic consequences.
0,Venezuela is the third largest exporter of oil within OPEC and the fourth as far as worldwide production is concerned.
1,There is very little doubt that Chavez did not voluntarily resign his office and was in fact removed from power by the army.
0,Oil prices took a sharp downward trend after the quiet semi-coup d'etat by the American affiliated Venezuelan army generals who deposed the popularly elected president of Venezuela Hugo Chavez on Friday.
1,"The price of crude had taken a dramatic upsurge in the aftermath of the ever-deteriorating Middle East crisis, the unilateral cut off of Iraqi oil by Saddam Hussein and similar threats by several other oil producing countries."
1,"In direct response, the Americans, who preach democracy to the entire planet, recognizing that they could no longer tolerate someone like Chavez reverted to their old bullying and dictatorial tactics and arranged for an army coup by several avowed pro-American generals, who managed to remove Chavez from power in a few short hours."
1,"However, Chavez who is known for his ala Fidel Castro left-leaning anti-American philosophy had on a number of occasions rebuffed US requests for more oil exports."
1,The fall of Hugo Chavez in Caracas is a crystal-clear message and warning by the US to anyone in the world who is contemplating to use oil as a political tool in the future.
1,This does not serve the interest of peace and the security of the peoples of the region in the long run.
1,"Before 1994, Israel was in control of all the occupied Palestinian territories and yet it was unable, despite all its forces, weapons, and measures, to achieve full and comprehensive quiet in the West Bank and Gaza throughout 27 years."
1,"It also tried, through this pressure, to remove the legitimacy of the PA and its chairman Yasir Arafat under the pretext of terrorism or support for terrorism."
1,"The Palestinians left no avenue unexplored in their quest for a settlement that enables them to regain their legitimate rights and provides all the peoples of the region, including the Israelis, with security and stability."
1,The United States realizes that the Palestinians are serious in their efforts to achieve a just peace.
1,"Certainly, the intensive efforts that our big sister, Egypt, made to bridle the Israeli oppressive activity and to warn the Israeli prime minister against targeting President Arafat and the PA are highly appreciated by the Palestinian people in particular and the Arab nation in general."
1,"In this context, we must note the role of all Arab and international forces in curbing Israeli military operations against Palestinian cities and residential areas and in explaining the true picture of the situation to the United States."
1,The situation and its tragic repercussions are being viewed only from the Israeli perspective.
1,"Such demands constitute the strong base for bringing about calm and stability, putting a final end to violence and terrorism, and turning a new leaf toward fruitful negotiations leading to a just peace acceptable by all sides."
1,"It is, therefore, unfair to blame the PA for the tension, and sometimes violence, that takes place as a result of the Israeli oppressive measures and activities."
1,The killing of hundreds of Palestinians and the increase in the number of martyrs among children are being ignored.
1,It would have perhaps been logical and acceptable if Washington had demanded a mutual and concurrent cessation of the ongoing violence between the Palestinians and the Israelis and called on Israel not to exploit the calm to open the files of security revenge through assassinations and arrests.
1,"It wanted the PA to meet difficult, even impossible, security conditions."
1,Every oppressive or vindictive Israeli action has a Palestinian reaction that cannot be stopped.
1,It would have been logical and acceptable if Washington had asked Israel to announce its commitment to the principle of withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 and to end the settlement activity.
1,"This US position, which is fully biased to Israel, strengthened Israeli Prime Minister Ari'el Sharon's attempts to suppress national Palestinian ambitions and achieve his declared objective of establishing Israeli security on the rubble of the legitimate Palestinian rights."
1,"For its own reasons, which are linked to its interests and, naturally, to Israel's interests, the United States chose to put intensive pressure on the Palestinian Authority."
1,"And the destruction of homes, installations, and PA infrastructure is being overlooked."
1,"On the contrary, it heightens the sense of frustration among all sectors of the Palestinian people and damages the credibility of the United States as a sponsor of the peace process, indeed as an effective partner in the settlement negotiations from the start of the peace process in the late eighties until this process faltered as a result of Israel's intransigence after Sharon came to power."
0,"The federal executive authorities, in particular the Economic Development and Trade Ministry, have been directed through the Russian Foreign Ministry ""to cooperate with the United Nations Supervision, Control, and Inspection Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency on issues connected with the functioning of the international mechanism for constant supervision and control in relations to Iraq""."
0,"In connection with this, a number of documents on exports of controlled goods and technology to Iraq, passed in 1997 and 2001, have been made obsolete."
0,"Moscow, 17 January: The Russian government has established a new mechanism to cover the export of dual-purpose technology to Iraq, which is subject to international supervision and control, the government information department said."
1,"But the premier also said that although short, he thinks his visits to the countries are still meaningful."
1,"Even if it\'s only for a day or two, it is significant to visit a country and exchange views with the people of the country in person,"" he said."
0,He stayed for less than a day in most countries.
1,"""But when I think of my duties as prime minister, I can\'t visit one country and not go to the other, or stay in one country for three days and stay in the other for only a day."
1,"""Of course, if I step down as prime minister, I can visit one country for a week each,"" he said."
1,"""I would like to visit various countries at a more leisurely pace -- meet with the people of the land and travel not only to the capital but also to rural cities for sightseeing,"" the premier told a gathering in Tokyo."
1,"""There is a saying, seeing is believing."
0,"Koizumi made a weeklong tour of the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore earlier in the month."
1,"If I am to visit several countries in a limited time, it is always one or two days at best,"" he said."
1,"Tokyo, Jan. 17 Kyodo -- Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who just completed a whirlwind tour of five Southeast Asian nations, said Thursday he longed for more leisurely trips -- but added that may have to wait until he leaves his post."
1,Moscow has expressed the wish to import more Mongolian meat.
0,"Moscow, 24 March: Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov is departing for Mongolia on Sunday afternoon [25 March] on an official visit, the premier's press secretary, Tatyana Razbash, told ITAR-TASS."
1,"At the same time, the ambassador said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that large Russian capital and businesses ""are not active enough in dealings with Mongolia"" at the moment."
0,"Moscow and Ulaanbaatar are continuing a political dialogue, actively developing bilateral trade, and consulting each other on international problems where their stands coincide or are close."
0,"Besides this, the Russian prime minister is scheduled to meet with Mongolian President Natsagiyn Bagabandi and the parliamentary speaker, Sanzhbegiyn Tumur-Ochir."
0,"The official programme of Kasyanov's stay in capital Ulaanbaatar will begin with a tete-a-tete meeting with Mongolian Prime Minister Nambaryn Enhbayar on Monday, followed by talks in an extended format and signing of several agreements."
0,The turnover of goods between Russia and Mongolia has reached 240m dollars.
1,"Russia's Ambassador to Mongolia Oleg Derkovskiy believes that there are no problems in relations between the two states and the common border stretching for 3,500 kilometres is a border of peace and good neighbourliness."
0,"Russia exports petroleum products, electricity, machinery and equipment to Mongolia and imports copper concentrate and meat."
1,He is also expected to be awarded the title of honorary doctor of the university.
0,"On Tuesday, 26 March, Kasyanov will address Russian and Mongolian entrepreneurs and visit Science and Technology University."
0,"On Tuesday night, Kasyanov will wind up his Mongolian tour and leave for Vietnam for an official visit."
0,"Large numbers of People's Liberation Army troops have also been seen on the move in the Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang, to the far west of China, they said."
0,Another official said Thursday the main expert on Xinjiang from the US embassy in Beijing had been dispatched to the region to discuss regional attitudes to the devastating terror attacks on the US two weeks ago and to Afganistan's ruling ultra-Islamic Taliban regime.
0,"""They were talking about China\'s \'development of the West\' program, China\'s policies on minority nationalities, our opinions on the September 11 attack and the Taliban forces,"" she said."
1,"She stressed the atmosphere in Kashgar, an ancient city along the historic Silk Road, was peaceful, although tourism and border trade in the region had been affected by the security situation."
1,"Authorities are only too aware that Kashgar is 4,000 kilometres (2,500 miles) from Beijing but only a tenth of the distance from the Pakistani border, and are desperate to ensure instability or militancy does not leak over the frontiers."
1,"BEIJING, Sept 27 (AFP) - China has arrested a number of suspected separatists in its territory bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan as part of a security clampdown ahead of possible US military strikes in the region, local officials said Thursday."
1,"In neighboring Hetian city, a hotbed of Muslim separatists in the impoverished southern part of Xinjiang that also borders Pakistan, the situation was also ""peaceful"", said an official at the city\'s foreign affairs office."
1,"Foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Tuesday China would take ""all necessary measures"" to ensure the stability of its border regions ahead of any US retaliatory strikes."
0,"""This crackdown is very normal, we always do these things every year before public holidays,"" she said."
0,"However Dong of the Kashgar foreign affairs bureau said the security clampdown was usual, and linked to next week's national day holiday."
0,"""Public sentencing rallies have been going on in many counties around Kashgar,"" the official, who identified himself only as Yakefu, told AFP."
1,"There have been a series of bomb blasts in recent years in Urumqi and Beijing, linked to Xinjiang separatists seeking to establish an independent state of East Turkistan."
0,"Marquardt held separate meetings with police, the minority religious affairs office and other departments, she said."

0,"Diplomat Arthur Marquardt arrived in Kashgar on Saturday and left Wednesday for the provincial capital of Urumqi, said Dong Jianhua at the Kashgar foreign affairs bureau."
0,"""Many tour groups have been cancelled, so the region\'s tourism has been affected,"" she said."
1,"""Many people have been arrested in the past weeks, including suspected separatists and criminals,"" said an official at the minority religious affairs bureau in Kashgar, Xinjiang, China\'s furthest west city."
1,"China has been keeping a particularly close eye on the situation in Xinjiang as expectation mounts the US will launch military action against Afghanistan, home to the suspected mastermind of the terror attacks, Osama bin Laden [Usama Bin Ladin]."
1,"""March appears to be a more reasonable estimate while earlier admission cannot be entirely ruled out,"" according to Chen, also Taiwan\'s chief WTO negotiator."
1,The vice minister said Taiwan's service industry was unlikely to sustain an excessive impact as it has been largely opened to private and foreign participation.
1,"Instead, service ventures in the financial, transport and telecom sectors should benefit from the introduction of advanced skills and expertise from abroad, he added."
1,"Taiwan-made products stood a good chance of becoming even more competitive thanks to wider access to overseas markets and lower costs for material imports, he said."
1,"However an expected increase in farm imports would certainly have an impact on the domestic agricultural sector, he said."
0,"Under a quota system, the tariffs on imported cars would be reduced from 30.0 percent in the first year after Taiwan's WTO entry to 17.5 percent in 10 years, he said."
1,"TAIPEI, Sept 27 (AFP) -- Taiwan is expected to officially become a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in March 2002, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Chen said Thursday."
0,Chen said Taiwan's external trade has less of a need to readjust itself in the post-WTO era as it has long functioned under a market-oriented economy and already largely conforms to international conventions.
0,"""We will also phase out internal protection of such products and remove export subsidies."""
0,"After having secured the approval of a working panel in Geneva, Taiwan's entry has yet to be ratified at the WTO's ministerial meeting set for Qatar in November and then undergo parliamentary deliberation at home, he said."
0,"Chen said Taiwan is set to reduce the average tariff rate on 1,021 farm products to 12.9 percent after its WTO accession from 20.0 percent currently."
0,"At the same time, the average tariff rate on 3,470 industrial items would be slashed to 4.2 percent eventually from the current 6.0 percent, he added."
1,He was criticized more than recognized for his policy.
1,"Feeling like a true ally, he was able to ask for a place for Russia almost inconspicuously - in NATO."
1,"Although these are sovereign states, and the final decision would have been in their hands, people familiar with the actual balance of power indicate that these states would have done nothing, had Moscow wanted a different thing to happen."
1,"Nevertheless, this amounts to such high degree of Russian-American cooperation in a wartime situation, the two sides have never attained during the past 10 years."
1,"Nevertheless, one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the United States called upon the Chechens to ""unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups,"" and that they accept Putin\'s offer to make peace."
0,"These countries are Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan."
1,"The military great power that towers over Afghanistan has committed itself to overthrow the ruling Taliban system, and has pledged to support the US ""anti-terrorism military operation"" now being prepared."
1,One cannot underestimate the significance of the fact that Russia has opened its airspace.
1,"If we view this warning against the background that Putin\'s government has always seen Usama Bin Ladin\'s hands behind ""Chechen terrorism,"" we were witnessing a late recognition of Moscow\'s views."
1,"Putin has no greater desire than to present to the West the Chechen independence movement as a chapter of ""international terror."" He did not succeed with that so far."
1,"After the Americans had promised everything good and nice, Putin remarked almost as an aside that the events in Chechnia ""could be interpreted only in the context of the struggle against international terrorism."""
1,"He argued that had the West not continued to keep alive during the past several years the Cold War stereotype of a threat from the East, but would have concentrated instead on terrorism, the common enemy, the twin towers of New York may not have collapsed."
1,But making this complex decision was not easy for him.
1,"In reality, Putin asked for a free hand regarding Chechnia, some understanding, or even that the Americans look the other way."
1,"Reformers told Putin all along that he should take advantage of ""the rare opportunity for (Russia) to become integrated with the civilized world."""
1,"He wanted to become an ally, and that's what he has become."
1,"True, Putin only permitted (Americans) to deliver via Russian airspace aid to the ""theater of the anti-terrorism military operations,"" (i.e. not soldiers and weapons)."
1,The situation in which Putin has agreed to open former Soviet military airfields to American armed forces in three (former Soviet) Central Asian countries could be regarded as dramatic.
1,"At this time however, he taught a lesson to the Americans."
1,"Accordingly, Russia has joined the anti-terrorist coalition of the United States virtually without reservation."
1,"In the end, a certain consideration that differed from the above two proved to be decisive."
1,"Putin has exceeded the ""positive neutrality policy"" his country (the Soviet Union at the time) has pursued during the Gulf War, and whose continued validity the military leaders also regarded as desirable."
1,"""Accordingly, at this time it is your turn to think,"" Putin said."
1,"Today, at the threshold of expansion, it is no longer a joke."
1,Putin has written the name of Moscow on the registration page of the American side.
1,"In Berlin, where he was the center of stormy celebration, he vindicated for himself the deeper truth that may be seen behind terror."
0,It had to do with Chechnya.
1,After Putin's statement they rubbed their palms at length.
1,Leaders of the United States probably withheld their breath Monday evening while watching on television what Russian President Vladimir Putin was about to say to his people.
1,And Putin has established the prospect of taking further steps in this regard.
1,"Putin did not receive what he sought in a quick response from Washington, namely, that the State Department would continue to encourage political dialogue between Moscow and the Chechen insurgents."
1,This would have been a joke only yesterday.
1,It amounted to much more than what one could have expected.
1,The Russian President has understood this American recognition.
1,"But main stream Russian military policy has been to keep a distance from America, the country that has been historically responsible for ""educating"" the Taliban that had caused the demise of Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan."
1,"President Pervez Musharraf will pay a state visit to China from 20th to 24th of this month at the invitation of the president of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin."
0,The visit will mark the climax of the events organized in connection with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
0,"The President will hold bilateral talks with the Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji, and Mr. Li Peng, chairman of National People's Congress."
0,"The President and Chinese leaders will review Pakistan-China relations with special focus on bilateral economic cooperation, regional issues including Afghanistan and Kashmir."
1,"Bilateral agreements regarding the Saindak copper and gold projects, Thar coal mines development, technical and economic cooperation, and a joint revolving fund for scientific research, and other hydroelectric projects are likely to be signed during the visit."
0,The annual trade between Pakistan and China hovers around $1 billion.
1,"Over the years, China has emerged as a key economic partner and an important source of external assistance for Pakistan."
1,"All three groups said it was essential that governments strike a balance between ""legitimate national security concerns and fundamental freedoms that is fully consistent with their international law commitments."""
0,"The statement comes two days after the British House of Commons passed emergency legislation allowing the detention of terrorist suspects without trial, and the killing of hundreds of Taliban inmates in a prison uprising in Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan earlier this week."
1,The killings prompted a call by London-based rights group Amnesty International for an inquiry into the affair.
1,The statement listed what it said were essential rights that could not be hollowed out because of the fight against terrorism.
1,"UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, Walter Schwimmer, Secretary General of the Council of Europe and Ambassador Gerard Stoudmann of the OSCE\'s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights said it was essential ""that states strictly adhere to their international obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms"" in the fight against terrorism."
1,"The United States earlier this week hinted it may expand its war against terrorism beyond Afghanistan to Iraq, bringing swift criticism from both Germany and France, who called for restraint in the future of the military campaign."
1,"Robinson, a particularly critical voice in guarding against human rights abuses in the wake of the September 11 attacks, said Wednesday the war on terrorism was taking a heavy toll on civil liberties."
1,"The Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said they were responding to recent ""worrying developments"" in some countries regarding human rights following the September 11 attacks."
1,"These were: the right to life, freedom of expression and religion and freedom from torture, while it also urged that the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes be avoided."
1,"STRASBOURG, Nov 29 (AFP) -- Three leading international organisations warned jointly Thursday [29 November] that the international fight against terrorism should not be a pretext for the violation of human rights."
1,"""While we recognize that the threat of terrorism requires specific measures, we call on all governments to refrain from any excessive steps which would violate fundamental freedoms and undermine legitimate dissent,"" a joint statement issued in Strasbourg, Geneva and Warsaw said."
1,"The agency said that the trade balance was favourable, at 1.84bn dollars over the period (the balance in January-September 2000 was favourable, at 2.89bn dollars)."
0,"Kazakhstan's external trade turnover, not counting unregulated trade, reached 11,305,400,000 dollars in January-September 2001, up 14 per cent year on year, the Kazakh State Agency for Statistics has said."
0,The CIS countries accounted for 30.9 per cent of total exports over the period (compared with 27 per cent over the same period in 2000).
1,"According to the directive, which is considered by many American lawyers to be in contravention of the country's constitution, judicial investigations into the cases of the defendants in military courts will be conducted without any possibility of bail."
1,This is a blatant case of discrimination in rights - something which is not practised anywhere else in the world.
1,They fear that these suspects may not receive a fair trial in America.
1,"Moreover, it places this country, which claims to be a forerunner in the sphere of human rights in the world, in the same rank as countries which restrict civil rights under the pretext of security considerations."
1,"Since the 11 September events in America, that country's administration has severely restricted the civil rights of the American people, particularly the foreigners residing in that country."
1,It is worth mentioning that in the past America had severely criticized and put pressure on other governments in the world for trying terrorist suspects in military courts.
1,"It has done so through passing the anti-terrorism law, issuing presidential directives, and sending secret memoranda to the judiciary under the pretext of fighting terrorism."
1,One such measure was a directive issued on 23 November concerning the creation of military courts for trying immigrants and foreigners suspected of involvement in terrorist activities.
1,"The American State Department had in 1999 condemned the government of Peru for the creation of a secret military court, and called on that country to accept international regulations, such as the need for open and fair trials and observance of defendants' basic rights."
1,"They have been divested of many of their basis rights, and their voices cannot be heard by anyone."
1,"And, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, it violates human rights - rights which are global."
0,"Currently around 1,100 suspects, who are chiefly from Islamic Middle Eastern states, are being held in detention."
1,"It appears that if the directive issued by Bush becomes law, then that country's re-entry into the UN Human Rights Commission, from which it was expelled this year, will become much more difficult."
1,"America, which always accuses other countries of violating human rights, is today placing terrorist suspects, who may even be innocent, in solitary confinement without access to any means of mass communication, thus depriving them of the basic human rights, in contravention of its own constitution."
0,Nor will they be allowed to appeal to American or international courts.
1,"The decision by Bush to create a military court for the trial of terrorist suspects has prompted European states, particularly Spain, to refuse to hand over to America more than 10 individuals suspected of belonging to terrorist groups."
1,The recent action of the American president clearly demonstrates the need for the American administration to observe human rights.
1,"In the 23 November directive, Bush has in effect drawn a clear line between the rights of American citizens and foreign immigrants."
1,"This has drawn a chorus of condemnation from the democrats in Congress, foreign governments and civil right activists in that country."
1,This increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is caused by industrialized nations.
0,"The seventh Conference of the Parties (COP 7) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October to 9 November."
1,"However, to protect their own interests, a few industrialized nations repeatedly made outrageous demands in past UNFCCC conferences."
1,Dr. Ren suggested that developing nations should also join forces in emissions reduction in the future.
1,This disaster can only be averted if we all join in to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to stop global warming.
1,It is a long road ahead of us.
1,"In other regions, it may fall precipitously."
1,"In order to implement the treaty as soon as possible, developing nations and the EU agreed to a compromise."
1,"In March, the new Bush Administration openly declared it would rescind its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the ""Kyoto Protocol."""
1,"According to Dr. Ren, humans released excessive amounts of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere in the past century, particularly in the past 50 years."
1,"Fundamentally, the targets set by the Kyoto Protocol are far less than what actually will take to effectively curb global warming."
0,The amount of greenhouse gases emitted by most developing nations in the past several decades only represents a small fraction of the total emission.
1,Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is higher than any time in the past several hundred thousand years.
1,It mainly requires the joint effort of industrialized nations to resolve global warming.
1,"However, future negotiations are not expected to be smooth either."
1,It needs monetary and technical assistance from industrialized nations.
1,Mankind should continue to work on a solution to global warming.
1,"In the Bonn conference in July, Japan even made new demands regarding the 1997 Kyoto Protocol."
0,"The Kyoto Protocol will officially be implemented after Earth Summit 2002 to be held in September in Johannesburg, South Africa."
1,This excessive emission of greenhouse gases has caused the mean global temperature to rise by 0.4 to 0.8 degree C in the past 140 years.
1,China's per capita emission is only one-sixth that of the United States.
1,The next step will be even more difficult.
0,Beijing 10 Nov (Xinhua) -- Expert's View on Global Climate Change Protocols
1,Its effort is well recognized around the globe.
1,"If emission of greenhouse gases is not rigorously limited and is allowed to continue to climb, then the average global temperature may surge by 1.5 to 5.8 C. The sea level will rise by nine to 88 millimeters."
1,It is a mistake for the United States to use such an excuse to evade its responsibility.
1,He indicated that there is a long way to go and a great deal of effort to put in before global warming can be successfully arrested.
1,Its excuses include that it will harm the US economy and there is insufficient participation by developing nations.
1,"Finally, a compromise was reached after developing nations and the EU made a significant concession."
1,"It has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions by efficiency improvement, energy conservation, and development of advanced energy technology."
1,And its total emissions continue to rise.
1,It will be disastrous to many countries.
0,He indicated that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is accumulated over the past 100-200 years.
1,"As a reminder, Dr. Ren pointed out: The Kyoto Protocol is merely a gesture for mankind to stop global warming."
1,Negotiation was stymied.
1,"He also pointed out: Although the Kyoto Protocol did not set a reduction target for China, however, China is very concerned about global climate change-related issues in recent years."
1,"There is no way for a weak, developing nation to absorb such a burden."
1,He also warned that an abrupt climate change might take place when a critical value of temperature rise is exceeded.
1,"During this conference, countries such as Japan, Russia, Australia, and Canada played the same tactic again to try to delay the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol."
1,The Kyoto Protocol was significantly weakened as a result.
1,"In certain regions, the temperature may rise suddenly and sharply."
1,"In addition, global warming will bring about frequent extreme weather phenomena, such as cold spells, heat waves, torrential rain, and tornadoes, to threaten our society."
1,Dr. Ren was critical of this irresponsible decision by the US Government.
1,"Furthermore, on a per capita basis, emissions by developing nations are also far less than that by industrialized nations."
1,"To implement the Kyoto Protocol, according to Dr. Ren, usually a country would incur an economic loss equivalent to 1 percent of its GDP when it tries to lower greenhouse emissions 1 percent."
1,"Dr. Ren Guoyu, an expert meteorologist at the National Climate Center of China, pointed out that the Kyoto Protocol was only the first step to resolve global warming during his interview with Xinhua News Agency."
1,The United States continues to refuse to fulfill its obligations.
0,"According to this expert, the United States is the largest greenhouse gas-emitting country in the world."
1,It will have a deleterious effect on mankind.

0,"Some of the visiting experts from 10 countries, including the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, France and Japan, have been arriving since Wednesday to call on key government agencies and local political leaders ahead of Saturday's elections for legislators, county chiefs and city mayors."
1,"In a meeting with 25 of the scholars Thursday, Tsai said in response to a question on whether Taiwan is afraid of over-reliance on the mainland market that the island will be able to achieve balanced economic growth as long as it strikes a balance between maintaining its sovereignty, developing its economy globally and normalizing relations with the mainland."
1,"The GIO added that Taiwan\'s accomplishment in democratization is the ""best role model"" for mainland China\'s progress toward democracy."

1,"High-ranking officials of the state and defense departments made preposterous remarks, saying that our country is the world's biggest exporter of WMD, ballistic missiles, and relevant technology."
1,The conduct of the United States will only invite worse criticism and rejection from world people in the future.
1,"We will fight the US imperialist war maniacs, including Bush, who try to threaten national dignity to the end and settle scores with them."
1,"Bush, in fact, should not have made such remarks in his State of the Union address."
1,It is also the United States that has placed the international situation in such a complex state and is going haywire to dominate the world.
1,We will continue to [unmonitorable for 20 secs] to US unjust acts in the future.
1,"As we mentioned earlier, it is the United States which produces and possesses the greatest number of nuclear weapons and WMD and it is also the United States that threatens other countries the most with these [weapons]."
1,"High-ranking officials of the US administration, including US Vice President Cheney, actively chimed in with his absurd remarks."
1,"As a matter of fact, the fellow who wrote Bush's address inevitably submitted his resignation."
1,"It cannot be anything but gangster-like logic for such a country to label other countries, which are dignified sovereign states and UN members, as an axis of evil."
1,"As everyone knows, the United States is currently getting strong criticism, denunciation, and rejection from many countries of the world, and is being cornered by impartial public opinion and the people due to Bush's referring to Iraq, Iran, and our country as an axis of evil."
1,What they have crafted out of this was our so-called sales of weapons of mass destruction [WMD] and ballistic missiles and concerned technology sales.
1,"Not satisfied with this, the United States is trying to develop new nuclear weapons by resuming underground nuclear tests in the future."
1,"The United States is indeed the ring leader and empire of evil, which perpetrates spiteful conduct of all kinds worldwide."
1,It is simply a blatant act of the world's worst rogue state to do someone harm.
1,It is the United States that possesses the world's largest quantity of WMD and inflicted nuclear disaster on humankind.
1,"According to a report, a majority of the residents even within the United States are denouncing Bush's reckless remarks."
1,"Inspecting US Air Force bases some time ago, Cheney maintained that the United States would not accept WMD threats."
1,"Following his vicious remarks that called our country an axis of evil in his State of the Union address, it has already been revealed that [US President Bush] talked nonsense that the targets of the US anti-terrorism war will include not only international terrorist organizations but also countries that develop weapons of mass destruction [WMD]."
1,The US imperialist war maniacs are clinging to a new conspiracy in order to escape such a predicament and divert the arrows aimed at them in other directions.
1,"Because the remarks absolutely do not go with the reputation of the United States, which is carrying out all kinds of vicious conduct."

1,The United States can never dampen or bend our unwavering will.
1,"The war maniacs of the United States' Bush administration continue to spew out vicious remarks against us, despite the strong protest and denunciation of people around the world."
1,The US authorities should stop these acts and making remarks that smear their own faces.
1,"This, in fact, signifies that he inevitably had to leave the White House, driven out by the anti-Bush hot winds from around the world."
1,"This is another diversionary tactic to divert the criticism of people around the world, which was provoked by the fact that Bush had made an announcement on an axis of evil and it had caused a great controversy to the world, to us."
1,"There is no question about the WMD-developing countries he pointed out, including our country as well as Iraq and Iran."

1,The British do not consider themselves to be European and are grateful to the Americans for their help in the Falklands War.

1,"Manicheaism comes to us from late antiquity thanks to Manes, the religion's founder."

1,"Fabius says he sometimes has ""the feeling that they believe countries are poor because they want to be."""
1,"The Americans do not see this, quite the contrary."
1,Who would have thought ten years ago that the United States would be capable of carrying fighters in an Afghan civil war across the sea and depriving them of their rights?
1,Evil in politics has truly become an unmanageable concept.
1,"The saying goes: ""I\'m an American and I\'m damned proud of it."""
1,"Weeks ago George W. Bush, who appears determined to install a new government in Baghdad, declared the creation of a Palestinian state as good as decided."
1,"They are vegetating in a place where they have no rights, because the intention is to deny them an appeal before court of law in the United States."

1,"It had been expected of the President that he would manage change in the world, Hoagland noted critically, and not try to change the world by command."
1,Today he says action could be taken without considering the Europeans.
1,"The most US-friendly member of the federal government, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, reproached Washington for its ""narrow concept of security"" meaning that there is not enough money for maximum arms procurement and development aid simultaneously."
1,"If it were only a matter of objective differences of opinion, than it would all be only half as wild."

1,Neither the United States nor Europe can count on them.
1,Secretary of State Colin Powell would have had to resign had he not given in.
1,One must not force Iran to the side of Saddam Husayn.
1,It is the American mentality indeed that we will not be able to change until the end of mankind.
1,So it has not done the US legal system any good that there is no enemy of consequence in sight.
1,It is not that China is only making a dynamic economic progress and becoming a military superpower.
1,"Of course, China will not concur with the United States' position, but it appears that the United States is trying to strengthen relations so that it can always convey a clear message to the Chinese side."
1,"This displayed intentions of both the United States and China to make Bush\'s China visit a ""new milestone"" for the two countries\' relations based on the trust built by Nixon\'s visit (as US Ambassador to China Clark Randt cited)."
1,It is preferable to gain China's understanding and cooperation on antiterrorism and strategic issues.
1,"Recently, both US and Chinese authorities often use the phrase, ""direct and constructive relationship of cooperation."" At the US-China summit talks, the gap between the two countries\' points of confrontation such as on the issues of Taiwan and Iran, China\'s exportation of weapons of massive destruction, human rights, and religious suppression was not bridged."

1,"Yet, the biggest significance lies in that the United States and China reaffirmed cooperation for the world and Asia's peace and stability."
1,There were no remarkable agreements at the summit talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin other than Jiang Zemin and Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao's promise to visit the United States.
1,"Bush\'s visit to China was set on the date of the 30th anniversary of ""former US President Richard Nixon\'s visit to China,"" which is said to be the ""week that changed the world."""
1,"Bush redefined China as a ""strategic competitor"" and increased the sales level of arms to Taiwan."
1,"This means that regardless of such points of confrontation, the two countries will develop a relationship of cooperation."
1,Bush's China visit this time also seemed as if the United States was returning to the engagement policy it took toward China during the Clinton administration era.
0,US President George W. Bush's East Asia tour came to an end with his final stopover at China.
1,"Bush made a commitment to a ""constructive relationship of cooperation"" at the US-China summit talks (in Shanghai) last October, and the US-China relations was restored."
1,The two countries' relations began to improve since China expressed active support for international cooperation against terrorism in the wake of the simultaneous terrorist attacks on the United States last September.
1,"The row between the United States and China on the US missile defense program, China's suppression of the religious group Falungong, and the collision of the US and Chinese military aircraft was only becoming worse."

1,"He also pretends that he besieges Arafat because so far, he was unable to confront the Palestinian resistance."
1,I do wish that Burns's statements reflect a true position that signals a return of balance to the US position in dealing with the reality of Palestinian-Israeli struggle.
1,"Ben Eliezer's raving coincided with the arrival of his assassin boss Sharon to Washington to take part in exerting pressures on the US administration, and persuade it that removing Arafat could bring about the Palestinian surrender, and halt violence as he calls it."

1,"He has called for helping aggressive Israel to put a traitorous agent at the head of the Palestinian Authority, who could accept its terms to ""assassinate\' the rights of Palestinians."
1,They even embody the bankrupt policy of Israeli criminal extremism and failure to gain legitimacy for its continuing occupation of the Palestinian territories.
1,The only interpretation for these accusations is that Arafat has formidable supernatural powers that enable him to defend the rights of his homeland and people against the unlimited capabilities of the Israeli occupying forces equipped with all the mighty US weapon technology.
0,US peace Envoy Burns has expressed this after his meeting with president Mubarak.
1,"If keeping Arafat captive, under siege with the Palestinian people by the Israeli occupying forces, is an affront to Palestinian, Arab dignity, and International justice, it is also a powder keg that will at one point explode, devastating what remains of the Israeli security."
1,"It is that same security that Sharon, the assassin, uses as an excuse to instigate struggles and wars, and promote instability."

1,It now transpires that we are living in a world threatened by tens of thousands of terrorists and that more are on the way.
1,The important thing is that the firmness that was apparent in Bush's speech means that the world should take seriously the possibility that the United States might achieve these goals.

1,It is feared now that the fight against terrorism might be a cover for other goals.
1,"Although it is one of many countries surrounding Afghanistan, Iran has an effective role to play in that country."
1,"What might have changed the Bush administration's position are the mixed signals coming out of Iran, which represent a true reflection of the internal political climate in that country."
1,A week ago President Bush warned Iran against obstructing stability in Afghanistan.
1,"In his speech, President Bush upped the intensity of the US military-political rhetoric but kept things vague regarding his administration's policy on Iraq or the future of ties with North Korea."
1,"It is as if he returned the world to the Cold War era, when the US foreign policy was driven by the notion of anti-communism."
1,"Some were surprised by President Bush\'s repeated reference to Iran as among the countries that make the ""access of evil."" This is because following the September operations there were some hints suggesting that Washington was viewing Iran from a new angle."
1,"Bush specifically named North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, countries that were formerly referred to as pariah and evil nations."
1,One of these goals is how to prevent terrorists and countries that seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction from threatening the United States and the world.
0,Bush has talked about some goals without telling us about the means that he will use to achieve them.
1,There was a smell of danger in President Bush's speech and it was clear in the United States' decision to adopt a tough policy.
1,"Because the speech was about the State of the Union, President Bush seemed like he was underlining the ""unilateral"" role of the United States, thus dropping the coalition against terrorism."
1,President Bill Clinton's administration tried to encourage rapprochement between the two Koreas.
1,Another goal is to prevent countries that support terrorism from threatening the United States and its allies with weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.
1,They are now getting trained in terrorist camps that are scattered in scores of nations.
1,The striking thing was the reference to Iran.
1,"As regards Iraq, despite the hints of war in President Bush's speech there were other hints suggesting that he might resort to other means to achieve his goal, such as economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, total boycott, limited military operations, and support for the opposition groups."
1,"In his address, Bush changed the warning from the ""evil empire"", the term used by former President Ronald Reagan to describe the Soviet Union and communism, to the ""access of evil"", the United States\' new enemy."
0,President Bush used his speech to give details about what the September terrorist operations have revealed.
1,"The problem is that many mistakes were committed then, and they were serious mistakes, in the name of this policy."
1,"The Secretary of Defense said reassuringly that the ""camp offers them hot showers, toilets, clean clothing, blankets, regular food, and the right to practice their faith."""
1,But also back then there were people who maintained that the treatment was almost overly humane.
0,"On the eastern side of the camp there is a sign in Arabic bearing the legend ""Qibla."""
1,But the judge himself has confessed to harboring serious doubts as to his jurisdiction in the affair.
1,"Out of all the United States' European allies, only British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said that he subscribes to the US Government's decisions."
0,"That is the word used to point in the direction of Mecca, toward which every Muslim is obliged to turn when praying."
0,"They have all had their hair and beards shaved completely off, among other things also for reasons of hygiene."
1,"In actual fact, none of the witnesses that have visited the camp has ever seen any meat at all."
0,The base in Guantanamo Bay was chosen for two reasons.
0,He is to be tried by a civil court.
1,"This is another of the ""privileges"" mentioned by Rumsfeld."
1,"Thus not only is it impossible to escape, but the humanitarian associations could never organize a protest rally in such a place."
1,Only the corrugated iron roof provides a little shade.
0,He has been taken to a jail close to Washington.
0,Los Angeles Federal Judge Howard Maz has given the government until 31 January to submit a memorandum in its defense against the charges being leveled at it by the human rights associations.
0,"The clothing in question is an orange training suit, identical for all the prisoners."
1,"But the concentration camp strongly resembles a dog pound, and no one would want his dog to be treated like that."
1,"It was chosen first and foremost because it is not US territory and thus no claim can be laid to the rights that the US Constitution guarantees to all prisoners, including foreigners."
1,"Washington -- If this is a man... Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld calls the treatment of the prisoners captured in Afghanistan and shut away in the US base at Guantanamo Bay on the island of Cuba, ""humane."""
0,In other words: no pig meat or meat from animals from which all the blood has not been fully removed.
1,"Everything is visible, just like with an x-ray."
1,"The New York Times and the Washington Post , after dithering for a few days, have now been saying in their editorials that a democracy must show itself to be such also by the way in which it treats terrorists."
1,Secretary Rumsfeld stressed with pride that the food rations provided are compatible with the tenets of the Muslim faith.
1,"On which topic, incidentally, the US Government does not recognize the Taliban combatants that fell into its hands in Afghanistan as prisoners of war."
1,He knows the charges that have been made against him and he is being assisted by a defense team.
1,"""War is war,"" he wrote in a letter to French daily Le Monde , ""and the safeguarding of human rights is clearly not the Pentagon\'s foremost concern, but Europe must shoulder this task."""
1,"That may be the reason why the camp, which stands segregated from the military base proper, has been called Camp X-Ray."
1,"What is taking place in Guantanamo is reasonable, humane, legal, proper, and compatible with the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war."""
1,"The walls, if that is what you can call them, are made of wire fencing."
1,There are no cells or even shacks; there are just cages measuring 1.5 mt. by 2 mt. and just over 2 mt. high.
1,The sharp shooters posted on the turrets and the patrols that tour the camp with their Alsatian dogs never lose sight of the prisoners: not even when the latter attempt to catch some sleep on the 5 cm. thick foam rubber mattresses or when they use the sanitary bucket.
1,A federal judge has agreed to examine an appeal made by human rights associations that are demanding that the prisoners be granted a regular trial.
0,"The prisoners shelter as best they can from the heat, which never goes below the 30 degree Celsius mark even in winter."
1,"For his part, Rumsfeld stressed that international protests ""have not been a factor"" in reaching this decision."
0,"There were toilets, but only for the guards; however, improvements are reportedly now being made in connection with the sanitary arrangements."
0,"On 23 January, when there were 158 prisoners in Guantanamo, the airlift from Afghanistan was suspended."
1,"In her book ""Beloved"" which won the Pulitzer prize back in 1988, writer Tony Morrison describes conditions far worse than those prevailing in Camp X-Ray."
1,The Saudi Arabian media have been quick to pick up on the difference of treatment that he has been granted.
1,"Johnny Walker, the US citizen who was fighting with the Taliban in Afghanistan against his own compatriots, has not been subjected to the same fate as the other prisoners."
1,"The prisoners emerge from their cages only to take a shower, to go for a medical, or to take their short daily walk."
0,"They move around with a chain on one foot, and each one of them is watched over by fully two marines."
0,"And second, you can only get into or out of the base on board a US Armed Forces helicopter."
1,"No Pig Meat -- Well, Actually, No Meat at All"
1,The US Constitution appears not to apply to the Arabs in the concentration camp in Guantanamo.
1,"""The accusations of ill treatment,"" Secretary Rumsfeld said, ""are completely untrue."
0,"The diet is based on beans, on rice, on cabbage, on bread, and on milk."
0,"The accusers, in their turn, have until 14 February to respond to that memorandum."
0,"""There is virtually no more room; work needs to be done on making the place bigger and better,"" a Department of Defense spokesman announced."
1,"And in any case, it did not apply even to black people held in jail in the southern United States until a few years ago."
0,"""The address on the envelope was written in poor Roman characters,"" local fire squad commander Roman Krumhanzl told CTK."
0,Czech Republic: Suspicious consignment appears in Karlovy Vary
0,"Karlovy Vary, western Bohemia, 15 October: The police and firemen closed the surroundings of a shop in Sokolovska street in Karlovy Vary before 11:00 a.m. [0900 gmt] today due to a suspicious envelope which the shop employees had received within the mail from abroad."
0,"Assisted by medical inspectors, firemen - wearing antichemical suits and respirators - put the envelope into a plastic bag."
0,They are waiting for the arrival of chemical experts.
1,"Presumed war criminals such as Milosevic enjoy all the guarantees of a fair trial, but the Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters at Guantanamo will get a trial which falls far short of the basic standards of the US Constitution and the treaty on civil and political rights ratified by the United States."
1,The consequences of 11 September are also making themselves felt far from the battlefield.
1,"There is, in the first place, the case of the military action in Afghanistan."
1,"There is a great deal of truth in that, but in the light of what has happened afterwards, the question arises as to whether the Americans and their allies themselves are not sometimes inclined to sacrifice these values for the ""good cause."""
1,"It is all the more to be deplored that such statements come from somebody who, as a senior commander, serves as an example to others regarding the observance of rules of humanitarian law."
0,"According to witnesses, these were attacks in an area where neither al-Qa'ida troops nor Taliban had been observed."
0,"Through that, the United States can detain and try anybody who is not a US citizen and who is suspected of being a member of al-Qa'ida or of being involved in international terrorism in one way or another."
1,"There also seems to be a difference among the foreigners: In all likelihood, captured British fighters will be sent to Britain after questioning."
1,There is no doubt that a military operation and intensified security measures were imperative after the terrible tragedy of 11 September.
1,"Apart from the reasons or justification for such an action, all the combatants' war conduct must be constantly tested against the standards of international humanitarian law; that is, the rules which curb the use of force during a military operation."
0,"If it emerges that the person concerned cannot be removed from British territory because he is in serious danger in his own country, he can be detained almost indefinitely under this law."
0,"A number of other countries have sharpened their laws following 11 September, from increased detention possibilities to stricter legislation on asylum and immigration."
1,"Even if these attacks were directed against a clear military target, the large number of civilian casualties would still never be justifiable, because whoever plans a military attack must take all precautions to prevent such a tragedy."
1,Other states have used the US tragedy to polish their own image.
0,"The two supplementary protocols to the Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977, increase, among other things, the protection of the civilian population."
1,"The need for timely and accurate information about possible new attacks is naturally particularly great, but whether the global ban on torture can be abused on that account is another matter."
1,"However, the ends -- dealing with those opponents -- does not justify all the means."
1,"Humanitarian law leaves no doubt that those who fall captive in their opponent's hands are entitled at all times to decent treatment, even if they do not qualify for prisoner of war status."
1,"Appeal is not possible, but the death penalty is."
1,That al-Qa'ida terrorists and Taliban fighters are not very concerned about the human suffering that they have caused is also generally known.
1,"Now, nearly two months later, concern about the fate of the captive Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters has further increased."
1,"Such a building enjoys the highest possible protection, and can and should never be the object of an attack, unless it is clearly established that it is being used for military purposes."
1,It is stated in black and white that it is hardly feasible for these commissions to apply the normal principles of law and rules of evidence.
1,"In the media, the possibility of questioning presumed terrorists very roughly is also being considered aloud."
1,"Newspaper headlines such as ""United Nations Confirms US Bombing of Village and Mosque"" and ""100 Killed in Bombing in Eastern Afghanistan"" speak for themselves."
1,"Hence you can hardly speak of a ""targeting error"" when a Red Cross warehouse, although clearly recognizable by the large red cross painted on the roof, was shelled twice by US aircraft."
0,"These rules, laid down in the four Geneva Conventions, provide, among other things, for the protection of sick and wounded servicemen and prisoners of war."
0,"Whenever there is a suspicion that a foreigner is involved in international terrorism, he will be arrested and imprisoned."
1,"Transporting these people, shackled hand and foot and with hoods over their heads, shaving their beards -- which form part of their religious identity -- and their ""accommodation"" in half-open and cages that are much too small can probably never pass this test..."
1,What raises even more questions is the order that President Bush issued last November.
1,"Under the protest of international and US human rights organizations but with the approval of large sections of the population, antiterrorism measures are being adopted in great haste."
1,"Shortly after its decision to take military action, the Bush administration also decided to provide the press with only sparse information about the course of the operation."
1,"Although it is doubtful that all the news reaches us from Afghanistan, a great many press reports suggest that humanitarian law was violated regularly over the past few weeks."
1,"The attacks on the World Trade Center Towers and the Pentagon were attacks on the freedoms and values for which the United States and the Western world stand, President Bush declared shortly afterward, and many people in Europe repeated it after him."
1,"Back in 1949, it was agreed by nearly all the states in the world that the sufferings of war must henceforth become more bearable, especially for those who are not directly involved in the conflict."
1,"In addition, attempts must be made to prevent any unnecessary suffering by both military personnel and civilians by, for instance, imposing restrictions on the use of weapons."
1,Because press freedom -- the jewel of the US Constitution -- can be restricted for reasons of national security.
1,Not only with the protection of the civilian population does something sometimes go wrong.
1,"Consequently, evidence will be accepted that ""a normal person"" deems to have the value of evidence."
1,"In December 2001, the UK proclaimed a state of emergency and passed the Antiterrorism, Crime, and Security Act."
1,Moving the captives to the Guantanamo Bay military base on Cuba is rightly whipping up a storm of protest.
0,Only special military commissions can try them.
1,"The fight against terrorism is undoubtedly justified, but, as with every struggle, it also holds true that the fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law must be respected."
1,That would amount to a flagrant violation of humanitarian law: whoever ceases fighting for whatever reason is entitled to protection.
1,Foreigners suspected of maintaining (loose) ties with terrorist organizations can be detained indefinitely.
1,"On the other hand, US Taliban or al-Qa'ida fighters, such as the recently captured John Walker Lindh, will be tried by ordinary US criminal courts."
1,"In other case, too, it seems doubtful that the crucial distinction between military and civilian targets was made systematically."
1,Not in the United States alone are the screws being tightened.
0,"Hence, humanitarian law requires that in all circumstances a distinction be made between military targets and those not involved in the armed conflict."
1,"But the greatest attention is paid to the fate of the civilian population: In principle, the latter can never be the object of a military operation."
1,"This has happened despite solemn pledges to the United Nations that the United States ""is committed to minimizing civilian casualties and damage to civilian property."""
1,"There is uncertainty about the precise number, but it is certain that over 1,000 men from the Middle East have already been arrested."
1,"Observance of these rules will not insure that the fight against terrorism is lost; it will prove respect for human dignity, of which the West is rightly a champion."
1,"Many countries are parties to them, but the United States has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which US troops are taking part."
1,"Out of well-understood self-interest, countries such as Russia, China, and Israel joined in the Bush administration's anti-terrorism campaign, because it enabled them to compare their domestic situation with the US situation and ask for moral support for the fight they have been waging against terrorism for years."
1,The right of citizens to such information about their government's actions is crippled by the fact that it is being accepted for the present without much complaint.
1,"Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called Palestinian leader Arafat ""Our Usama Bin Ladin."""
1,"Hence guilt need not be established ""beyond reasonable doubt,"" nor is there any mention of a presumption of innocence."
1,"Secretary Rumsfeld\'s statements (on 20 November 2001) that ""the United States is not inclined to negotiate surrenders, nor are we in a position, with relatively small numbers of forces on the ground, to accept prisoners,"" and that ""my hope is that they will be either killed or taken prisoner (by the Northern Alliance)"" also suggested that death would be the only way out of the conflict for the Taliban and al-Qa\'ida fighters."
1,"As such they face the prospect of being subjected to the due course of law and in the final analysis perhaps sentenced to death in closed military courts instead of in open courts, as is the right of prisoners of war under the terms of the Geneva Convention."
1,"And for this reason, too, they have a moral duty to speak out, as Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, among others, did yesterday."
1,"In an antiterrorist war that at the time was initially launched as Operation Infinite Justice, it is infinitely difficult to reconcile oneself to the pictures of chained and humiliated Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo base on Cuba."
1,"The pictures resemble an attempt to satisfy a primitive thirst for revenge and convince the Americans that the Bush administration has not only succeeded in removing a regime of religious madmen in out-of-the-way Afghanistan, but also in taking prisoner some of those responsible for the terrorist acts on that day in September."
1,"With its behavior, therefore, the United States is not only compromising the image of the war against terrorism as an expression of a higher form of justice, but also of itself as an unshakeable defender of this same justice."
1,Many of them have already demonstrated great skill in their own behavior when it comes to exploiting the West's fear of terrorism.
1,"The U.S. and most recently the British governments reject the suggestion that the prisoners are being harmed, but this does not alter the fact that the pictures of hooded prisoners in chains are in themselves enough to paint a picture of a United States that in the name of self-righteousness - and equally worryingly: without any great amount of debate - has allowed itself to infringe international rules."
1,"This will undoubtedly rub off on the superpower's allies, including Denmark."
1,"Otherwise they face the risk not only of undermining the legitimacy of their own antiterrorism war at present, but also of sending out a signal that despots around the world will know how to exploit."
1,"For most people it will of course be difficult to mobilize any great degree of understanding for those responsible for the bloody terrorism in the United States on that day in September, but what is at issue here is that at the present moment principles are at stake that could have far-reaching repercussions for the future war against terrorism."
1,"Instead the superpower has entered a legal fog where the prisoners have been stamped with a nonsense term in international law: ""battlefield prisoners."""
1,This impression is reinforced by the fact that for the time being at least the United States has ignored the Geneva Convention and refused to treat those taken prisoner as prisoners of war - something to which they have a right - until a competent court has decided differently.
0,"In the countries in which torture is systematically carried out, for example Cuba or China, inspection by international organizations is not permitted."
1,"However, we may be witnessing a distortion of reality, and even in some cases pure falsehoods."
1,The result of the report will have to be taken into account before political and moral judgments of guilty or not guilty are made.
1,"If these accusations are confirmed, the only possible definition will be torture and the violation of human rights."
1,"The photos were sent voluntarily to the press by the American authorities, who clarified that they depicted a group of 20 dangerous prisoners who had recently arrived at the base and undergone a process of identification prior to their confinement."
1,Spanish daily urges caution in judging USA's treatment of suspects
1,But this enormous difference is not enough.
1,These were in no way their normal living conditions.
1,Nor does it seem proper to cite the fact that the base is not on American soil because it is a rented base.
1,It must be known as soon as possible whether or not terror has been established in Guantanamo.
1,"But the decisive fact is the presence for days of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is preparing a report and which, as usual, has refused to make any statements."
1,Indications exist that the system to which the prisoners are subjected is excessively harsh.
1,It is another matter to launch into scandal or anti-Americanism.
1,The United States government does not help dispel the suspicions when it refuses to consider them prisoners of war and therefore to apply the Geneva Convention to them.
1,"In any case, the attitude of the American authorities has nothing to do with the one previously and currently displayed by dictatorships and totalitarian systems, including communist ones, which permit neither inspection nor the dissemination of photographs."
0,"For the time being, the members of the British government who interviewed three prisoners of their nationality have received no complaints about the treatment they are receiving."
1,"Critics condemn the inhumane nature of the treatment the prisoners are receiving, handcuffed, immobilized with shackles, subjected to sensory deprivation and confined to minute cells."
1,"But for the time being, what exist are indications and shadows of suspicion which must materialize or be dispelled through knowledge of the facts from the relevant reports."
1,Herein lies the difference.
0,It will speak in its report.
1,"Backing from a majority of the public would not serve, either, as justification for the possible excesses and violations of rights."
0,The dissemination of some photos taken of a group of detainees in Guantanamo has aroused international controversy.
0,Aktau seaport is Kazakhstan's only international seaport with annual transshipment capacity of 1.5m tonnes of dry cargo and 8m tonnes of oil and oil products.
0,"Aktau, 22 January. The Aktau Sea Trading Port republican state enterprise (RSE) on the Caspian Sea (situated in Mangistau Region of western Kazakhstan) handled over 116,000 tonnes of cargo between 14 and 21 January [2002]."

1,"""The prisoners must be treated with respect for their integrity and religion, and they must be given a fair trial,"" Fogh Rasmussen says."

1,Per Stig Moller: Give Them Rights
1,""" Social Democratic Party: Raise Denmark\'s Voice"
1,Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller (Conservative People's Party) is urging the United States to guarantee the prisoners the status of prisoners of war and in consequence protection under the terms of the Geneva Convention.
1,"""It cannot be the duty of the Danish Government to applaud everything that the Americans do."
1,"EU foreign affairs spokesman Javier Solana, among others, has also criticized the United States for not recognizing the al-Qaida prisoners as prisoners of war as understood in the Geneva Convention."
1,"""Of course the United States has a point when it says that it can be difficult to decide who are terrorists and who are prisoners of war."
1,This ideology was explicitly embraced by the rightist blocs in the ruling Israeli coalition and is implicitly encouraged by Labor Party ministers in the current Israeli Government.
1,"It is the Palestinians that are calling for the implementation of the agreements, understandings, and recommendations pertaining to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict."
1,This is especially true after the Palestinian Authority [PA] carried out the difficult Israeli demands and arrested three individuals whom Israel accuses of assassinating Israeli Minister Rah'avam Ze'evi despite the ramifications that these arrests could have led to on the internal Palestinian arena.
1,"However, it appears as if the international community is tolerating the Israeli campaign of suppression that contradicts the efforts to calm down the situation and the Palestinian hand that is stretched for peace and a settlement."
1,"However, the repeated Israeli message is the resort to all means to impede the march for peace and to consecrate violence and counter violence."
1,The Palestinians believe that such a step would realize their national aspirations to full sovereignty despite the perils and implications that such efforts may have on their national unity that puts the higher Palestinian interests above every other consideration.
1,"This state of affairs provides suitable conditions to Israel to continue its occupation, colonialism, and building of settlements that have been imposed by military force on the Palestinian territories since 1967 to date."
1,"So far, Israel's provocations have led to the slaughter of more than 50 Palestinian males and females and injured scores of others."
1,No one expected the Israeli Government to issue its latest decision restricting President Yasir Arafat's movements and confining him to the city of Ramallah.
1,They believe that such a step would lead to a permanent settlement of this conflict on the basis of the resolutions of international legitimacy.
1,They believe that these constitute a preliminary step to the resumption of the peace process at the point at which it stopped.
1,The Palestinians are sending out a clear message of peace that is loud and clear.
1,"However, the awareness, the challenges of the current stage, and the sense of responsibility overcame all the temporary factional considerations."
1,"Moreover, the attacks are continuing on the Israeli military checkpoints even against vehicles transporting pregnant women in labor and against unarmed citizens trying to cross these checkpoints that have been erected between the beleaguered Palestinian towns and villages that are surrounded to the point of strangulation."
1,They are no more than frail excuses and pretexts to evade the peace process since this process does not agree with the ideology of expansion and the building of settlements.
1,It is clearly obvious to the international community that the Palestinians seek peace.
1,Israel's impossible terms cannot be met by a nation that is determined to preserve its dignity and national unity.
1,These Israeli aims are clear and do not need further clarification or explanation.
1,"It is to be noted that over the past five days, the Palestinian side demonstrated clear self-restraint and abidance to the cease-fire despite Israel's provocations and the bloodbaths that the Israeli army committed against the Palestinians during this period."
1,France says time is right for joint US-European action on Mideast
1,"""This support will be an asset for Mr Colin Powell, to whom we renew our support in his difficult mission,"" according to the communique of the spokesman of the French Foreign Affairs Ministry, Francois Rivasseau."
1,"United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the European high representative for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), Javier Solana, and the foreign ministers of Spain and Russia, Josep Pique and Igor Ivanov, on Wednesday called on Israel to ""withdraw immediately"" from all Palestinian areas that have recently been occupied and collectively expressed their full support to the Middle East mission US Secretary of State Colin Powell is going to undertake."

1,"The suspension came just after Switzerland said it was slapping sanctions on the southern African country, including a freeze on financial assets which might be held by government officials in Swiss banks."
1,"""It is a bad report that can only lead to bad decisions,"" Moyo said, denouncing the report as ""opinionated"" and ""one-sided"" and saying it ""lacks credibility and cannot withstand any objective scrutiny."""
1,"The surprise decision comes after the 54-nation group failed to reach agreement on sanctions against Harare before the voting, when African leaders rallied around the anti-colonialist Mugabe, who has held power since independence from Britain in 1980."
1,"The panel had been expected to defer or reject calls for Zimbabwe's suspension after Mbeki and Obasanjo held talks Monday with Mugabe and defeated opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, and apparently proposed to mediate in talks between the two sides."
1,New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff welcomed the Commonwealth's suspension of Zimbabwe but said New Zealand was likely to impose sanctions anyway.
1,"The decision, taken by a three-way panel of Howard and presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, follows a damning report on the March 9-11 vote by Commonwealth observers."
1,"""To some extent we have the sense that this is a halfway house,"" he said."
0,"""This issue will be revisited in 12 months\' time,"" he said."
1,"Zimbabwe's Information Minister Jonathan Moyo immediately blasted the decision to lump his nation in with Pakistan, which is also currently suspended from the Commonwealth."
1,"Tsvangirai, who had been tipped to win a free and fair election, has said he would negotiate with a view to running a fresh election and ""restoring legitimacy"" but on Tuesday he ruled out any ""meaningful discussions"" unless Mugabe\'s government cracked down on violence."
1,"The suspension validates ""our own refusal to accept the result as legitimate,"" said Welshman Ncube, secretary general for Tsvangirai\'s opposition Movement for Democratic Change."
1,"""The committee decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth for one year with immediate effect,"" Australian Prime Minister John Howard told reporters here."
1,"A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said: ""He clearly welcomes the decision by the Commonwealth troika and believes that it is absolutely the right thing to do."""
1,"Goff said that while he welcomed the suspension, it appeared it had been done reluctantly."
1,"Washington is still mulling a response to the election and ""continuing its conversations with allied nations about what the proper response should be to the fraudulent election in Zimbabwe,"" said Ari Fleischer, spokesman for US President George W. Bush."
1,"Tsvangirai had earlier suggested that ""Mbeki and Obasanjo are not going to allow that (suspension), they are going to present a position that the Zimbabweans are talking, so there may be a deferment of any action."""
1,"The report concluded the poll had been marred by violence, intimidation and suspect electoral practices designed to benefit Mugabe, a conclusion also reached by the Zimbabwean opposition and much of the West."
1,"""They were held in terms of our laws and our constitution, and the next election is not for six years."""
0,"The latest killing of a white farmer, Terry Ford, came just a day after Mugabe's inauguration."
1,"In his inauguration speech on Sunday, Mugabe promised to accelerate his controversial land reforms begun in July 2000, which aim to resettle blacks on white-owned farms in a bid to reverse colonial-era injustices."
1,"Although Mbeki has not specifically given his own views, an official South African observer team said the election result should be respected."
0,"""The presidential elections are over,"" the information minister said."
1,The land reforms have been marred by political violence led by liberation war veterans who support Mugabe.
1,"Most international observer groups have condemned the conduct of the poll, as have many Western governments, notably Britain and the United States."
1,"Foreign Secretary Jack Straw also praised the decision, saying that ""the message could not be clearer."""
1,"LONDON, March 19 (AFP) - The Commonwealth suspended Zimbabwe for one year on Tuesday, taking action against the regime of President Robert Mugabe a week after controversial elections returned him to power."
0,Mugabe was declared the winner of the presidential vote with 56 percent of votes to Tsvangirai's 42 percent.
1,"But at a summit in Australia earlier this month ahead of the election, Commonwealth leaders postponed action against Harare over its defiant stance on the presence of certain international observers to monitor the voting."
1,Critics of the land reforms say the measures have also aggravated a food shortage in Zimbabwe that threatens to worsen because of drought.
1,"If a rocket launch fails, debris weighing hundreds of tonnes will be scattered over the densely-populated island of Java or the tourist island of Bali, and on to the east as far as Timor."
1,"The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad, work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002, with launches beginning from 2004."
0,"But in conversation with Kompas on Sunday (17 Mar), one of Indonesia's few space law experts, Prof Dr Priyatna Abdurrasyid, expressed a different opinion."
1,This is a very important lesson for Indonesia.
1,"The kangaroo country should implement risk management procedures before opening the space station on Christmas Island, and open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states, and open complete access to cooperation to all states without exception."
1,"Nevertheless, intact pieces of debris weighing up to 20 to 30 tonnes fell into the Pacific Ocean."
1,"Notwithstanding the above, in reality only three of the 15 launch pad centres worldwide are located near the Equator - Kourou, San Marco and Sriharikota."
1,"Australia's plans to construct a space port on Christmas Island, located just a stone's throw, a mere 500 kilometres south of Jakarta, has concerned some in the Indonesian Government."
1,"At such close proximity, if bilateral relations with Australia were to take a turn for the worse, firing at Indonesia would be extremely easy."
0,"The Convention basically sets out the responsibility of the launching state, either jointly or collectively, for the consequences of a launch failure from the time of launching through to the re-entry of a satellite to the Earth's atmosphere."
1,"Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made, the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia."
1,"But the famous US space centre, the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida is located relatively far from the Equator."
0,International law governing accountability if one nation's space debris falls on another is already in existence.
0,"These UN Conventions are the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies 1967 (Space Treaty 1967), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects 1972 (Liability Convention 1972), and finally, the Convention on Registration of Objections launched into Outer Space 1974 (Registration Convention 1974)."
1,"A National Space and Flight Agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if Indonesia, as a state that has suffered damage, were to lodge a damages claim."
1,"Of course, lodging a claim is not as simple as clapping one's hands."
0,These principles are upheld in the Space Treaty 1967.
1,"Fortunately shrapnel from the former space station, which measured 33 x 30 x 27 metres and weighed 137 tonnes, burned up as it re-entered the earth's atmosphere somewhere over the Pacific Ocean between Chile and Australia."
1,It would suffice to submit a claim to the UN Claims Commission and state that the space debris in Indonesia had originated from the Australian space centre.
1,"""If Australia then denies the claim, we need only demand that Australia produce proof that the space debris did not originate from its space centre activities."
1,"Unlike other experts, Priyatna believes that Indonesia should not be too concerned [about the Australian planned space station]."
1,"Indonesia would not need to produce further evidence to substantiate its claim, he said."
1,"On the other hand, Christmas Island is certainly an ideal location for rocket launches due to its proximity to the Equator and the geostationary orbit (GSO)."
1,"As the nation most likely to suffer the impact of the Australian Space Port, Indonesia could rely on the simplest article in the Liability Convention, Section 14."
1,"Therefore, plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia's objections."
0,This convention only applies to space objects that fall into Indonesian sovereign territory.
0,"""The Space Treaty 1967 obliges launching states to open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states in all its activities."
0,"The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 28 March 1972, known as the 1972 Liability Convention."
0,"Indonesia has only adopted one compensation principle, the Absolute Liability principle."
1,"""In principle, my personal opinion is that we shouldn\'t go against the current."
1,"This is no different to arbitration hearings to resolve other cases,"" Priyatna said."
1,"In the case of objections to the Christmas Island space station, Indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the Christmas Island station."
1,The memory Russia's Mir space station which after 15 years fell to earth on 23 March 2001 is still fresh of.
1,"Rather than issuing a letter of objection to the Australian Government, wouldn\'t it be better to join them in our own national interest?"" he asked."
1,Indonesia at the very least needs to sign the UN Convention on Space as well as ratify several other treaties governing national activities in outer space.
1,This would of course require advanced technology and great cost to bring the matter to a claim submission.
0,This principle means that the burden of proof that the claimant state has suffered damages does not lie on the state submitting its damages claim.
1,"But the problem is, who can ensure that these guidelines will indeed be adhered to?"
1,"The problem is, this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket, fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory, but will also disrupt flights and shipping."
0,"This section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the International Claims Commission, which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state (in this case Australia) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state."
0,The basic principles of the Space Treaty 1967 oblige Australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour.
1,"Meaning that rather than challenging and issuing objections to the Australian space project, Indonesia should take advantage of our southern neighbour's space activities."
1,"Australia should adhere to the Cardinal Principle of International Law, which states that all nations in the world must first respect and promote the humanitarian interests and progress of all humankind."
0,"Prior to that, two Soviet satellites struck the earth."
1,"The treaty also pledges that the launching of space objects be purely for humanitarian purposes and not for military purposes,"" Priyatna said."
1,"In claiming compensation from the Soviet Union over Cosmos 954, Canada was forced to navigate numerous procedural complications."
0,"So far, the Indonesian Government has only ratified the 1972 Liability Convention."
1,"If a deadlock in negotiations occurs, the parties can ask the UN Claims Commission as a neutral party to act as adjudicator."
0,It is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching.
0,The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states' space projects.
1,"""Australia is not allowed to prevent other states who want to cooperate on its space centre."
1,Even more worrying is the possibility that a space station could be transformed into a military base and pose a threat to Indonesia's national sovereignty.
1,"Rather we should the use the current to our mutual benefit,"" he said."
1,"Unfortunately, historical precedent shows that claiming compensation is no easy matter."
1,Indonesia can exploit this principle of the Space Treaty 1967.
0,"Cosmos 1402 in January 1978 fell over the Northern Hemisphere and Cosmos 954, which contained radioactive substances, crashed above the uninhabited tundra of Canada in September 1977."
0,The delegation is led by AmCham Singapore president Landis W. Hicks.
1,"Meanwhile, Rini said after a meeting with the AmCham delegation that almost all of the delegation members had praised the current security situation in the country."
1,Some local radical groups threatened to attack U.S. interests and citizens in Indonesia following the U.S. government's move to strike at Afghanistan several months ago.
1,"US Ambassador to Indonesia Ralph L. Boyce praised the Indonesian government on Monday [18 Mar] for its efforts to protect foreign investors in the country, including Americans, but warned that investors were still concerned about the security of their investments."
0,"Boyce, along with 12 members of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Singapore, earlier met with President Megawati Soekarnoputri and Minister of Trade and Industry Rini M. Soewandi."
1,But the government was quick to give assurances about the safety of foreign workers in Indonesia.
1,"But, he said, ""Investors will come to Indonesia not based on fears, somehow, that they would be physically threatened, but rather in the hope that the capital invested in Indonesia would be secure and that means transparency, rule of law, protection legally, etc.,"" Boyce told a press conference."
1,"""We take seriously the government\'s responsibility to protect Americans -- not only Americans but also other foreigners in Indonesia."
1,"""The Singapore-based members of this mission want to hear from senior members of the Indonesian government about efforts to expand foreign business participation in the economy."
1,"We know that Indonesia is a country of enormous potential and believe that now is the time to build our future together,"" Hicks said in a statement."
0,"The delegates include Tan Hup Thye from Refco Singapore Pte Ltd., Stuart Dean of GE International, and Edward Gilbert of Merrill Lynch (Asia Pacific) Ltd."
1,"Boyce acknowledged that the Indonesian government had taken serious steps to ensure the personal safety of American investors and other foreigners, who appeared at risk several months ago during the political tension following the US-led war against Afghanistan's Taliban regime."
1,"Rini said she had pointed to the Batam and Bintan islands as secure places for doing business, citing the small number of labour disputes in both islands."
0,The AmCham delegation is in Indonesia for a two-day visit to assess business opportunities in this country.
0,Some U.S. companies temporarily closed their offices here following the threats.
1,"Thus roles were distributed specifically and clearly, and each role was drawn accurately and with care, exactly as was the case in the great movie ""The Second Wife"" between the tyrannical mayor with power, Abu-al-Ila, the simple peasant who owns nothing but the clothes on his back and a gang of children, and his wife, who was coveted by the mayor."
1,"Therefore, the United States endeavors hard to save Israel from the serious crisis that Sharon has put himself into."
1,"Then you find a dramatic portrayal of the reversed situation in which the Shaykh, or in this case the ""US,"" Anthony Zinni, advises Abu-al-Ila, ""Palestinian,"" to bow and accept the mayor\'s, ""Israel\'s,"" demands, or else he would be convicted of possessing weapons of destruction in the eyes of the authorities."
1,"Thus, after the US mass media and newspapers revealed the report by the Pentagon that listed seven countries to be attacked with US atomic weapons in case US national security was threatened, it became clear that the United States develops and produces weapons of mass destruction to threaten the stability and security of the world, and that it violates the United Nations Charter attacking independent and sovereign nations."
1,"Immediately a neutral intermediate appears, represented in the fake imposter Shaykh, who is the friend of the mayor in the axis of evil."
1,"Namely that the countries of the axis of evil, from his point of view, are those that produce, develop, and amass weapons of mass destruction in a way that threatens the security and stability of its neighbors, as well as all the countries in the world."
1,"We can review, for example, the voting results in the Security Council to see how Washington always defends Israel, then how Britain always justifies the stances by both countries in admirable harmony."
1,"The countries of the US axis are similar, for they cooperate, are joined by a strategic bond, and each defends the other and supports it with words and deeds."
1,"Of course the second side in the US axis is Israel, and definitely the third side will go to no one but Britain, as it conforms to the same criteria and because it completely supports the US stance and considers it the absolute right in all cases."
1,"So now we only wait for the advice of Haj Zinni to obey those in authority, so that we would not become terrorists like Iraq, North Korea, and Iran!"
1,"It has now become our right to announce clearly that the United States had become one of the sides of the axis of evil according to the same criteria set by the United States itself, and declared by its President George Bush."
1,"If US moves go beyond China's limits of tolerance, it will seriously affect Sino-US diplomatic relations."
0,This does not mean that China and the United States have achieved any progress on the Taiwan issue.
1,The two cases contrast sharply.
1,"""Bush cannot conduct himself in an upright manner and he speaks insincerely!"""
1,"Yu Keli, deputy director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences [CASS], said that since taking office, the Bush administration has gone farther and farther in ""interfering in China\'s internal affairs and meddling in the Taiwan issue"" and has entirely run counter to the aspirations of the two peoples for the healthy development of Sino-US relations."
1,On public occasions Bush seems to show consideration for the US anti-China forces and pro-Taiwan faction and to even appease Taiwan separatists.
1,Now the United States sees her former friend as an enemy and her former enemy as a friend.
0,"Li Jiaquan, research fellow at the CASS Institute of Taiwan Studies, said: During his visit to China, Bush steered clear of the Sino-US three joint communiques and one China on two important occasions, his joint conference with Jiang Zemin and his speech at Qinghua University."
0,"Japan's militarism used to be the US enemy, while China used to be a friend of the United States."
1,"However, in his meetings with Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji, Bush stressed one China and the Sino-US three communiques."
1,"Li Jiaquan felt that it is very appropriate to quote a line from Guo Moruo, ""confounding right and wrong, being kind to the enemy and hard on friends,"" to describe the United States."
1,"Compared with the Clinton administration, the Bush administration evidently is in retrogression on the Taiwan issue."
1,"Sun Yan, assistant professor at the International Relations College of the Beijing University, also held that on the issue of international anti-terror cooperation, the United States wanted to rope in China in order to remove obstacles to its next phase of attack against Iraq."
1,"Beijing, 19 Mar (Wen Wei Po)--In response to the US decision to allow Tang Yao-ming to visit the United States, experts on Taiwan affairs said here in interviews with this reporter that this showed a lack of sincerity by the United States in improving Sino-US relations."
1,"The entire world -- not the Palestinians alone -- is waiting to hear an official Israeli statement regarding its recognition of the Palestinian national rights and its readiness to withdraw from all lands occupied in 1967, put an end to the settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza, and support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state de facto."
1,"Some Israeli officials, particularly Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, have stated that the success or failure of US envoy Zinni's mission hinges on the Palestinians only because they might carry out a suicide or shooting attack that will make Israel retaliate, thus bringing the region back to the cycle of violence."
1,Such a statement will actually constitute the beginning of a real era of peace and the end of the era of violence and counterviolence.
1,"Such an Israeli statement would not only serve Zinni's mission but would also accelerate the attainment of a permanent arrangement in which Israel would gain peace and security in exchange for its withdrawal from the Palestinian lands, the end of its colonialist occupation, and the renunciation of its mentality of domination and expansion, which have caused calamities and catastrophes in the past five decades."
1,"Clearly, the Palestinian side has acceded to all demands -- even more than that -- when it recognized Israel's right to exist on 78 percent of historical Palestine."
1,"The coming days and weeks will show whether Israel is actually ready to positively and objectively deal with the Palestinian national rights without trying to maneuver, place obstacles, or set impossible conditions during Zinni's mission."
1,"In any case, Zinni's mission is to make sure that certain measures are adopted as soon as possible to pave the road to a political settlement of the Palestinian question."
1,"Consequently, Zinni will find it difficult to attain a cease-fire and commence the implementation of the Tenet understandings and Mitchell recommendations."
1,"This allegation contradicts the simplest fact on the ground, as Israel is the one that occupies most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Israel is the one that possesses vast military power which it uses to make incursions into and raid Palestinian cities and refugee camps; to intimidate women and children; to assassinate innocent activists and citizens; to destroy buildings, facilities, infrastructure, roads, water pipes, and electricity and telephone poles; to attack Palestinian ambulances and kill medical teams; and to carry out other retaliatory, suppressive, and devastating practices."
1,It cannot make more concessions.
1,Israel's compliance with the required commitments will be the real test not only of its readiness to facilitate the US envoy's mission but also its readiness to establish a just peace which is in the interest of all parties concerned.
1,"The army would like to request whoever is engaged in this criminal activity, to stop,"" he said."
1,The Mozambican soldiers have promised to act quickly.

1,BETHANY - The number of illegal immigrants in Swaziland seems to be increasing.
0,The USDF found 43 Somalians inside two kombis in Maphiveni and 23 others were found without travel documents at Matsamo border and were handed over to the Horo police.
0,Last month members of the Umbutfo Swaziland Defence Force [USDF] found 594 illegal aliens in the country.
0,"Last month, 53 cattle were also stolen around the country, of which 17 were spotted inside Mozambique driven by three men armed with rifles thought to be AK47s."
0,The USDF also found four stolen cars in different places in the country.
0,"These include a Nissan Skyline in Mafutseni, a Mercedes Benz, A Toyota and an Isuzu 2.5 diesel at Nkalashane."
0,"According to the army spokesman, Corporal Nhlanhla Dlamini, the key areas where most of the immigrants were found was Lomahasha, Mhlumeni and Sitsatsaweni."
1,"""We have discovered that there is a certain family around Lomahasha, which is suspected of assisting illegal immigrants with shelter and transport."
1,Methodist Bishop Purity Malinga on Tuesday echoed the sentiments of South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) chairwoman Brigalia Bam that Zimbabwe election did not conform to international standards.
0,"""Many people were also unable to vote because their names were not on the voters\' role."
1,"""We were also advised to be vigilant in what we say in private and in public,"" Malinga said."
1,"SAOM on Monday stopped short of declaring the Zimbabwean presidential election free and fair, but the African National Congress majority on the committee declared the poll ""credible""."
1,"Under these circumstances nobody can feel free."""
0,The election was run by the police and the army who carried weapons.
1,She said international observers were treated with suspicion by the police.
1,"The majority report, endorsed only by the ANC, said the observer mission had noted that over three million Zimbabweans had cast their votes and this substantially represented the will of the people."
1,"Even local observers could not enter these stations,"" she said."
1,DURBAN March 19 Sapa SA OBSERVER: ZIM ELECTIONS NOT FREE AND FAIR
1,"Malinga, who represented South African churches on 50-member mission, told journalists during breakfast at the Diakonia Council of Churches in Durban, that she was uncomfortable with the manner in which the team had been treated -- even before they left South Africa."
1,"The Inkatha Freedom Party, Democratic Alliance, New National Party, African Christian Democratic Party, the Pan Africanist Congress and the United Christian Democratic Party had disagreed with the ANC conclusion."
1,"Malinga said according to the guidelines in the booklet, the election had been legitimate."
1,"""Personally I felt that one is going to be used here, but I nevertheless hoped the presence of outsiders in Zimbabwe would stop some illegal acts which may have been committed."""
1,"In a preliminary, Motsuenyane declared the Zimbabwe poll ""legitimate"", adding they could, however, not be openly described as free and fair."
0,At another station we were ordered to stay at least 100 metres away.
1,The United Democratic Movement was still undecided.
1,"""At one station were not allowed in and told that we had nothing to do with the Zimbabwe issue."
1,"""Even in the queues at polling centres there was a lot of fear and tension."
1,Another member of the South African Observer Mission to Zimbabwe says the past weekend's presidential election in the southern African country was not free and fair
1,"They were turned away in twenties, thirties and fifties."""
0,Each member was handed a booklet containing guidelines on Zimbabwean election laws.
1,Other delegates in SAOM aligned themselves with the findings of the Southern African Development Community parliamentary forum that said the vote had not met SADC's norms and standards.
1,"The United States, Britain, local Zimbabwean observers, and the Commonwealth observer team also described the poll as not free and fair."
0,"The booklet was published by the Electoral Institute of South Africa, in Pretoria."
1,"She believed that SAOM head, Dr Sam Motsuenyane had probably based his findings on the guidelines."
1,"Malinga, who was based in southern Matabeleland near Beitbridge, said the election were characterised by -- among others -- intimidation."
1,"Bam on Sunday said she believed Zimbabwe's election was not free and fair, adding they were not in line with international standards as well as those of her organisation."
1,It is notable that the Commonwealth observer mission did not move again although the opposition had now joined them in the same hotel.
1,C'wealth mission conduct questionable
1,"But how could Blair have ""a Commonwealth report"" when no one else had received such a report that should be channeled through the Secretariat to all members, asked one of the other 53 Commonwealth leaders at the retreat?"
1,"These are some of the realities that Presidents Obasanjo of Nigeria and Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, confronted as they flew from Harare last night for their meeting in London tomorrow with the Australian leader who is the third member of the Commonwealth troika."
1,"Blair's second faux pas in Australia, according to some of the assembled Commonwealth leaders, came in his response to a remarkably conciliatory speech by Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister, Dr Stan Mudenge."
1,"A Namibian woman member of the Commonwealth observer mission, who is the well-respected, Deputy Speaker of the National Council in her country, held different views to those stated in the interim Commonwealth report that was released only after the election results were known."
1,The hand symbolised reconciliation; and Blair accepted it.
1,"The final straw that confirmed that Australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, ordered his High Commissioner in Harare not to attend Sunday's inauguration of Robert Mugabe as President of Zimbabwe."
1,There was also the curious appointment of and behaviour by individual members of the Commonwealth mission who should have been sworn to secrecy as part of their mission and who should have expressed their views only through the chair of the mission.
1,"Furthermore, as anyone who has been following the Zimbabwean Press can testify, many of the Meikles farms around the country have been acquired by the State as part of the land reform programme."
1,"Although the Commonwealth missions nominally operate on the basis of ""consensus"", she and others of a similar view were dismissed as ""troublemakers"" by one of the former Secretariat staff-cum-observer."
0,"And close by, Howard will have the British government and the western media."
1,"Howard, however, will not be isolated at the three-member meeting at Marlborough House in London."
1,"Normally staff make up the Secretariat in support of a mission populated by more eminent, neutral persons."
1,No doubt Blair will fight on.
1,"By A Special Correspondent - Britain\'s Prime Minister, Tony Blair, privately did two things concerning Zimbabwe during the recent ""retreat"" by Commonwealth leaders in Australia that raise questions about today\'s meeting in London by the troika of Australia, Nigeria and South Africa."
1,Why were several former and recent employees of the Commonwealth Secretariat accredited as observers?
1,"The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Don McKinnon of New Zealand is also known to support his country's decision to condemn Zimbabwe's presidential election."
0,"While the Commonwealth observer mission and many of the foreign journalists were assembled in the hotel, the opposition leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Morgan Tsvangirai, moved in with them, taking a complete floor for himself and his entourage."
1,Meikles Hotel has long been known as a hot bed of opposition politics.
1,"The Commonwealth leaders, many of them in the first place unable to understand the dispute between Zimbabwe and its former coloniser, Britain, breathed a collective sigh of relief at what they hoped was the beginning of the healing process."
0,"During the 2000 parliamentary elections, 80 rooms at Meikles Hotel were booked by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)."
1,"But the solution to the present impasse lies with the people of Zimbabwe and Africa, not with the people of Britain and Europe."
0,They had been pre-booked by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs into the partly Government-owned Sheraton Hotel.
1,"Instead, an Australian member of the Federal Parliament, Julie Bishop, vented her anger towards the President and Government, and the electoral process, in Australia's media."
1,"The Nigerian leader, President Olusegun Obasanjo, had urged the minister not to attack Blair frontally over Britain's negative position regarding Zimbabwe, but to deal with the presidential election preparations in a dispassionate and precise manner."
1,"Meanwhile, back in Harare, some strange things were happening with the Commonwealth mission."
1,Then Mudenge proposed that Britain and Zimbabwe bury past differences and work together in the future.
1,"But there was still an unanswered question in the minds of the Commonwealth leaders: How had the British Prime Minister seen the purported ""Commonwealth report on Zimbabwe"" when they had not?"
0,The Zimbabwean minister did this.
1,"The British leader fudged his reply and the Commonwealth leaders were left with the distinct impression that the ""Blair report"" had already been written in London before the Commonwealth mission even left for Zimbabwe."
1,The first was that Blair said he had received an interim report from the Commonwealth observer mission to Zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before Zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote.
1,The composition of the Commonwealth mission raised further questions.
1,Their mission was simply to rubber stamp the adverse report that Britain had already written.
1,"Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki, however, have the benefit of their own observer missions to Zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth."
1,"The Australians, in common with other white members of the Commonwealth, the European Union (EU), the Americans, Norwegians and the Swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and therefore Mugabe as the head of State."
1,"And, in line with Commonwealth consensus, the views of the majority are taken to be the views of the Commonwealth as a whole."
1,"Then Mudenge rose to his feet, strode over to Blair and thrust out his hand."
1,"On the spurious grounds that the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) election campaign centre was in an adjoining building, the Commonwealth observers moved out to the privately owned Meikles Hotel."
1,"There, unlike the Sheraton where the national newspaper The Herald is distributed to guests, the pro-opposition Daily News is given freely to guests."
1,"But because of their openly hostile position towards the President and Government, the BBC was refused accreditation to cover the presidential election."
1,"However, since this is a new concept, there may be room for negotiation."""
1,"These are geostrategic plans at moments when time is exerting pressure, and also pressing the speed at which the world turns."
0,"Eduardo Duhalde's agenda, during his first departure from the country since he assumed the presidency, calls for a key meeting on Friday with the IMF's managing director, Horst Koehler, (which he will attend accompanied by Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov), and two occasions on which he will have the floor, addressing the world (for five minutes on one, and three minutes on the other) concerning the topic under discussion; the Monterrey Consensus: or greater assistance from the developed countries to those that are underdeveloped, which in fact will be approved by consensus."
1,"""Well, one never knows,"" slipped in the source, becoming lost on an escalator."
1,"And, while striding hastily through the large facilities of the International Business Center (Cintermex), he sketched an explanation: ""Argentina is the leading case of an era in which everyone pays dearly for his mistakes, and somehow manages as best he can."
1,"As soon as he arrives on Wednesday, Duhalde will meet with Fox, perhaps spearheading the explanation of the Argentine situation to Bush: a possibility that is not entirely clear among the Mexican officials, especially since, in principle, the virtual plan will have to take place step by step."
1,"""Certainly not,"" was the comment made in a private dialogue with La Nacion by a diplomatic source from the United States who, with a legion of colleagues, is attending the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development that opened yesterday in Monterrey, Mexico."
1,"Apparently not in Monterrey, where Bush will have a full agenda, and without contacts with other chief executives, except for Mexico's President Vicente Fox, and Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien, since they are trading partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)."
0,The same thing is happening to the countries now.
1,"""First I listen, and then I will see,"" commented one of them to La Nacion."
1,"According to some sources, the crisis is in a bind: the IMF is asking for more belt-tightening, and the government is asking for more money."
0,More Political Than Economic
1,"Despite this, it gives a clue to the gap that existed, and still exists, between the reality and the statistics of the international credit agencies."
1,"A source from the United Nations observed ironically: ""If Chile were Iraq, and if President Ricardo Lagos were Saddam Hussein, Argentina would have Bush\'s full support."" Chile is not Iraq, nor is Lagos Saddam, fortunately, of course."
1,"The source commented: ""Argentine is in a position to be an alternative reference point for the United States, to the detriment of Brazil which, in view of the internal and external vicissitudes facing Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is, day by day, becoming somewhat weak."""
1,"Ergo: without belt-tightening there is no money, and without money there is no belt-tightening."
1,"If someone earns 1,000 and spends 1,500, he will inevitably succumb to bankruptcy."
1,"With a strategy that would permit Duhalde, if he does not receive a clear signal from the IMF, not to call for elections in 90 days, for example, and to become a lame duck, waiting for his successor, he explained."
1,"It is common knowledge, among most of the small groups, that the Argentine crisis is more political than economic, and that, as one Latin American diplomat accredited to the UN remarked, the formula in question does not hold much mystery: ""A rapprochement with the United States is indispensable, because it is the only one that can extricate them from this."""

1,"With 58 chief executives immersed in signing a document which, as La Nacion was told by the Argentine ambassador to the United Nations, Arnoldo Listre, gives a clue to the direction in which we are heading: ""It shows a new organization in which the market economy is accepted as a fundamental factor for development and, unlike the cold war, is rid of the North-South confrontation."""
0,It was learned that Foreign Minister Carlos Ruckauf and Foreign Secretary Jorge Castaneda may already have talked about this.
1,"UN Secretary General Kofi Annan himself said, in his time, that the situation of indebted, undeveloped countries must be consideed, so as to avoid the repetition of a crisis such as ours."
1,"Monterrey, Mexico--Choked, hushed voices, some of them astounded, are not guessing correctly about the dilemma of the chicken or the egg into which the Argentine crisis has become converted, almost grotesquely: will the International Monetary Fund (IMF) endorse concrete aid to the country, apart from the presumable good intentions of its board members and technicians, without the approval of George W. Bush?"
0,"In that document, the Monterrey Consensus, free trade, the amendment on the distortion with agricultural subsidies, and the treatment of the external debt as fundamental pivotal points, benefit Argentina."
0,"In the documents, Argentina ranks in 59th place for its per capita income: $7,440, according to the World Bank's report on development: a substantially devalued figure after the default and the end of the currency board arrangement."
0,"The iridium container left Studsvik in Nykoping on 27 December and was shipped via Norrkoping, Arlanda, and Paris to Memphis."
0,"""When we open it, the whole picture will be cleared up,"" Hakansson said."
0,The container with the radioactive substance iridium 192 was transshipped at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris by the shipping company Federal Express.
1,"""However, it is extremely unlikely that the leak occurred during the flight from Paris to Memphis,"" Hakansson said."
0,The SSI is now attempting to trace people who could have been exposed to the radiation leak.
0,The iridium container will be examined in New Orleans by US authorities and Studsvik's own personnel within the next few weeks.
1,Studsvik expects to get confirmation of the information it has received today.
0,"When the container was transshipped in Paris, measurements showed no abnormal levels, according to the US Transport Department."
0,"""It this information is correct, it means that fewer people will have been exposed to radiation,"" said Hans-Bertil Hakansson, Studsvik managing director and concern chief, to DN [Dagens Nyheter]."
0,"The event is classified as a level-three incident on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), and is the most serious ever in Sweden."
0,"The Swedish and US authorities are looking for people who might have been exposed to dangerous radiation, but there is no indication that the container started to leak in Sweden."
0,The SSI says that this involves about ten people in Sweden.
0,"According to all indications, the radioactive container sent from the nuclear technology firm Studsvik to the US did not leak during transport within Sweden."
0,It is still not clear where the iridium container began to leak.
1,"Yesterday [07 January], the National Institute of Radiation Protection (SSI) announced that it could not exclude the possibility of people who had come into contact with the container suffering acute health effects from radiation."
0,A container from the Swedish nuclear technology firm Studsvik has leaked radioactive materials.
0,The US Transport Department has now informed Studsvik that the measurements done by Federal Express in Paris showed no abnormality.
0,"On arrival, measurements showed that it was emitting far too much radiation."
0,This is Sweden's most serious incident so far involving radiation.
0,This means that no leak occurred before the container left Paris.
0,Measurements done at Studsvik before dispatch had not shown high radiation values.
0,All shipments from Studsvik Isotope Service have been halted until further notice.
0,"The pilot who was supposed to fly the container to the US was equipped with a dosimeter, which measures radiation levels."
1,"""But as we received it from a US official, we believe it is reliable,"" Hakansson said."
1,It will discuss the bills on euthanasia and palliative care that the Senate approved in the autumn of 2001.
1,It includes a few VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] deputies who are very critical of the senators' work.
0,"The Chamber will treat the bill differently than the Senate, which worked with a joint justice and public health committee."
0,"Yesterday [8 January], this committee initiated a hearing on palliative care."
1,"A resolution proposed by Yolande Avondroodt (VLD) requesting working out a ""palliative care plan according to a patient\'s needs"" is based on this bill."
0,"Brussels -- This week, the Second Chamber will initiate the debate on euthanasia."
1,"However, SP.A [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party - Different] Deputy Fred Erdman has drafted his own bill ""regarding the problems connected with terminating one\'s life and the condition of terminally ill patients."" VLD Floor Leader Hugo Coveliers and party member Maggie De Block also have a bill on euthanasia."
1,"Ever since then, the Senate's work has been subject to increasing criticisms, including from groups that support a possible law on euthanasia."
1,The Chamber apparently wants to push ahead with the debate on euthanasia because available speaking time is very limited.
1,"The criticisms mainly focus on the applicability of the Senate's bill, the lack of a palliative filter prior to committing euthanasia, the supervisory role of the assessment committee, which is likely to be understaffed, and the nonexistence of fixed penalties for unjustifiable cases of euthanasia."
0,"The Chamber's health, environment, and social emancipation committee will only have an advisory role."
1,"Moreover, the Chamber's justice committee seems to want to go it alone regarding the euthanasia debate."
1,"According to the CD&amp;amp;V [Christian Democratic and Flemish], this is why this committee has only been given an advisory function."
0,This committee is scheduled to start the debate on the Senate's euthanasia bill today.
0,"As many as 117 people and 58 vehicles crossed the border through that checkpoint on Monday, the spokesman said."
0,The two detainees aged 26 were taken to a picket of the Derbent border guard detachment for a probe into the incident.
0,"Servicemen of the Sochi border guard department protecting a section of the Russian-Georgian frontier apprehended another violator on Monday, the spokesman said."
0,A 33-year-old citizen of Romania tried to enter Russia illegally from Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia.
0,"According to the spokesman, heavy snowfalls and the risk of avalanches still limit the traffic on the Caucasus highway and Military Georgian highway."
0,The Nizhny Zaramag checkpoint on the Russian-Georgian border is closed temporarily.
0,"The Verkhny Lars checkpoint is operating, but the number of people using it is very small."
0,"STAVROPOL. Jan 8 (Interfax-AVN) - Two citizens of Iraq were detained on the Russian border on Monday when they attempted to cross into the country illegally from Azerbaijan, a spokesman for the North Caucasus regional border guard department told Interfax- Military News Agency."
1,This announcement was met with unanimous condemnation by the international media.
1,"The Bush administration either refuses to sign, ratify, or implement international treaties or asks for their revision."
1,"Pragmatism is, in the first place, the United States' traditional policy."
1,"At one time, he said the new US missile defense system would not pose a threat to the international security and would not trigger an arms race; on another occasion, he stated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1972 was ""a product of the Cold War era,"" and thus has lost its binding force."
1,It does not want anything to do with countries and organizations that do not follow its orders or that always cause troubles to it.
0,"Before the 11 September event, the United States kept its distance from Pakistan and imposed sanctions on it."
1,"After the 11 September attacks on the United States, the international community strongly condemned the terrorist acts and expressed sympathy and support to the American people."
1,"Following the end of the Cold War, the United States has become the world's sole superpower and the trend of pragmatism in its foreign policy has become clearer and clearer."
1,"Bush said, ""Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists"" and ""any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime."""
1,It only wants the international treaties that benefit the US security and economy and globalization.
1,"Bush stressed that the war is not only the ""US war"" but also a ""world war."""
1,"Hard on the heels of that decision, the US negotiation representative Marie Chevrier announced in Geneva that the Bush administration would not support the implementation of the ""Biological Weapons Convention"" and that the United States strongly objected to the concrete enforcement plan of this convention."
1,One of the main US diplomatic goals for this year is to persuade the international community to accept the NMD and Russia to agree to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty [AMD] by flashing a carrot on a stick.
1,"He even claimed that to develop the NMD, the United States would be even prepared to scrap the ABM."
1,"Since coming to power, Bush, proceeding from the US immediate interests, has also adopted the pragmatism and unilateralism position with regard to international treaties."
1,"After coming to power, unilateralism and pragmatism have become Bush's main foreign policy line."
1,Alternate use of and complementary nature of pragmatism and unilateralism constitute the characteristics of the Bush administration's diplomacy.
1,"The Sino-US plane collision event that occurred on 1 April can best illustrate the US alternate application of the ""two-isms"" in its diplomacy."
1,"The responsibility for the event, in which a Chinese plane crashed and a Chinese pilot perished, lies completely with the US side."
1,"The international community and even US western allies, including US neighbor Canada, have consistently opposed the plan."
1,"Even after the adoption of the resolution on ""maintaining and abiding by the ""Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty"" on 29 November at the 56th United Nations General Assembly, the United States still persisted in carrying out a fifth missile interception test."
1,"Supported by the world, the United States launched the ""war against terrorism"" of this century."
1,"But after the Chinese side released all the US crew members, major US political figures changed their stance immediately and threatened to use human rights, trade, and Olympics hosting issues to ""retaliate"" against China."
1,"In a word, the US development of the NMD is for the purpose of ""attacking other countries and at the same time preventing other countries from attacking it,"" thereby genuinely securing its status of being the ""sole super power."""
1,But the United States obviously practices pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan -- a frontline state in the fight against Pakistan.
1,"This March, catering to the interests of the US oil and coal barons who have made large political donations to the Republican Party, Bush announced, without prior consultations with its allies, that the United States would not enforce the ""Kyoto Protocol"" which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the world."
1,"The United States views itself as a ""major force of anti-terrorism,"" for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism."
1,"In the plane collision event, if one goes by the US logic, only the US spy plane is permitted to spy at other people's doorsteps; the host, on the other hand, does not even have the right to look after its doors and to protect its yard."
1,"In July, the Bush administration decided to let the ""Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty"" ""freeze"" in the Senate."
0,"Over the past year, Bush increased funds for research and testing for the N!\nMD and accelerated the test frequency of the anti-missile system"
1,"Despite the opposition, Bush went it alone."
1,"Whether the United States will continue to treat Pakistan in a responsible manner, it is anybody's guess."
1,It is in fact like using multilateral diplomacy to enhance US unilateralism.
1,"The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that ""US crew members were detained by the Chinese side."" It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government\'s firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology."
1,"Once coming to power, Bush insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System [NMD]."
1,"It does not want anything to do with the international treaties, mechanisms, and organizations that restrict or prevent US freedom."
1,But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it.
1,The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country's attitude toward it.
0,"The permanent council is still to adopt a new mandate which would make the OSCE, among others, responsible for training a new Macedonian police force, helping to organise a census and new elections, he added."
0,"But the monitors' mandate, established in 1992, only includes surveying the security situation and the return of refugees, an OSCE official said."
0,"The OSCE comprises 55 states in Europe, central Asia, the United States and Canada."
0,Monitors have been present in Macedonia for some years alongside European Union observers.
1,"That means Macedonia's stability will depend on other organisations, including the OSCE."
0,"NATO has entered Macedonia to collect weapons from the guerrillas, but its 30-day mission is due to end on September 26."
1,"""In the meantime, doubling the number of monitors should help put people\'s minds at ease,"" he said."
1,"Macedonia has asked for more monitors, hoping they would help stop the country plunging into civil war between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and the Slav majority of the population."
1,OSCE ambassadors from the organisation's 55 member states agreed to send the additional monitors after Russia lifted its objections to the beefed up presence.
1,"Russia had slowed the decision, which was expected to have been announced a week before, raising concerns about their mandate in contrast with that of the NATO mission to collect weapons from ethnic Albanian rebels."
1,"VIENNA, Sept 6 (AFP) - The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe agreed Thursday [6 September] to send 25 additional monitors in Macedonia, joining the 26 observers working to prevent a new Balkans war in the republic."

0,The defense chief will be in Indonesia on Monday flying in via Hong Kong for talks with his local counterpart and other defense officials.
0,Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka will also attend the events.
1,"The whole incident was in fact unprecedented in the history of European democracies, and has prompted a whole range of controversies and debates."
1,"Whereas, beforehand, it was anticipated and hoped that the agreements reached at Genoa would help bring about beneficial results for the Bonn conference as well."
1,"Critics of the meeting, on the margin of the conference, up held the view that the American government, instead of heeding the wishes of international community, and protecting the security of world nations, and above all the safety of its own citizens, has paid more attention to the interests of corporations and huge arms producers and military-industrial complexes that reap tremendous profits annually from the sale of such armaments."
1,"The conference opened with fierce demonstrations by the opponents of economic globalization, who maintained that what is being concocted by globalization is in fact poverty."
0,Here are the views expressed by two of the prominent characters attending the Genoa Conference.
1,"At the Bonn Conference too, the agenda was to tackle and discuss the most urgent and indispensable factors concerning the life of humankind."
1,"The second feature was that both conferences ended without effective result, and the decisions taken and resolutions adopted there lacked conclusiveness and were not operational."
1,"As regards the recent conference (Bonn Meeting), although the past gatherings like the Hague meeting and Kyoto conference have proved to be failed experiences, nevertheless as the climatic and atmospheric crises are growing more serious, one can be optimistic and hopeful about the success of such protocols and pacts, and implementation of the agreements, even though they are not protected by any sanctions."
1,"It can safely be claimed that the events in Genoa have influenced [overshadowed] the very conferences in New York and Bonn; whereas, from the onset, the weak results of Genoa was foreseeable for most observers."
1,The joint demand and stand by the majority of countries attending the conference was encountered by firm opposition by the United States [of America].
1,"The Bonn Conference however, which dealt with the global environment and examined the condition of world climate, could be appraised as an exception and a relative success."
1,"Because, from the very start it could be predicted that on the subject of economic globalization, the developed and capitalist states were going to come across fierce opposition by dissident groups and the supporters of economic growth in poor countries."
1,"To recap, if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of New York and Genoa questions regarding: promotion of world security, improvement of economic conditions, defusing regional and global crises and conflicts, checking unleashed competition for rearmament, reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries, and ... could be addressed and appropriate, serious, and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted, the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely."
1,"Regarding the American proposed Anti-Missile Defense System too, neither Russia, China, Japan, nor even the European Union, had shown any enthusiasm; rather they had all expressed their reserves on the project."
1,"After two weeks of discussion and exchange of views at the New York Conference, it was decided to pay heed to the resolute demands advanced by the majority of the participants, who emphatically insisted on the imposition of a ban on the sale of light weaponry."
1,"And it is likely that until each party seeks its own particular interest in the conflict, and until the rivalry persists, the question would continue to remain unresolved."
1,"The remarkable feature of this conference was the joint resolution adopted by 180 countries worldwide --- in regard to protection of environment, and above all reducing the emission of greenhouse gases ---, which has isolated America in an undeniable way."
1,"What, however, was most remarkable in the conferences in New York and Genoa, was the fact that most decisions made, were based on interests and tastes of particular groups [lobbies]."
1,"Concerning the environmental protection issue, the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases, and warming up of the planet earth's climate too, which was somehow related to the [agenda of] Bonn Conference, America had relentlessly demonstrated its paradoxical [as published] [controversial] position and particular stance opposed to that of other developed states by her previous abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol."
1,"American delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale, possession, and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [as published] of American citizens, and equal to reducing their margin of security."
1,"In the remarks made by these political leaders, one point is interesting and calls for reflection: if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations, while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them, then it must be said that they are only the elected [leaders] of their own nation [people], and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide!"
1,"[Sentences are as published] The most important of the three conferences, which subsequently gained even more prominence, was the conference in Genova; perhaps even more so for the results ""not obtained"" at the conference, and which led to the subsequent intense dissatisfaction and frustration of the leading industrial states attending the meeting."
1,This is while possessing arms for self-defense is itself a factor that breeds insecurity.
1,"The governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda, including: economic globalization, the anti-missile shield defense project, the Kyoto Protocol and environmental protection, the political and military crises in the Middle East, the Balkans, and Afghanistan, moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries, and ... [as published] They meant to reach some form of agreement or understanding about those issues, but unexpected events left all that in limbo and uncertainty."
1,"Jacques Chirac, the French President, responding to the protests leveled by opponents of globalization, had said: ""They have no right to present themselves as defenders of the world poor..."""
1,"During the past weeks Europe and America witnessed the arrangement of important international conferences, which could on the one hand guarantee the peace and stability of the world, or could instead deteriorate the conditions."
1,"But paying heed was not tantamount to endorsement of the demand launched by those countries; rather, the final result came out as a compromise solution and a relative back up by the majority group."
1,"Similarly, Gerhard Schroeder, the German Chancellor, too had claimed that the participants at the summit meeting were the true, legitimate, and elected representatives of the people of their countries."
1,"Even the eagerness for playing an intermediary role in the Middle East crisis has given rise to fierce competition between America, European Union, and Russia and China."
1,"It was due to this isolation that America, in spite of discrediting [undermining] the Kyoto Protocol and declining to comply with the Bonn Conference [resolution], was forced to at least make a promise to cooperate in preventing an increase in air pollution."
1,(It should be noted that the issues moved at the conference were declared unofficial and lacking validity [legal force] even for the participating countries.)
1,"[Exclamation mark as published] In view of the criticisms, which have been made, they could perhaps be also considered to be the representative of powerful corporations that have placed the whole ""world economy"" under their influence, and as a result of that they are also controlling the world of politics globally."
1,"When Italian police intervened and roughly handled the demonstrations, things got out of hand; the already volatile situation reached boiling point, violent clashes broke out, and the killing of one protestor overshadowed all other issues."
0,"The conference in New York, which dealt with a ban on demand for light arms, and the Genoa Conference which had a much wider and extended agenda, had two common features between them."
1,The first was that large and numerous bodies of dissidents were opposing the wishes and interests of a small but powerful group.
