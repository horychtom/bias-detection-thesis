\section{Motivation}

\section{Bias}
Defining the word \textit{bias} can be a bit tricky, because with different settings and different goals the definition also shifts. A lot of work done in bias also lacks the proper definition and often includes vague descriptions of their goals \cite{blodgett2020language}. 

In terms of \Gls{ml}, bias usually means a tilt, prejudice, or tendency that, during the training, gets into the model and may subsequently lead to potentially unfair decisions. The bias is typically skewed towards some group of people, e.g., \textbf{racial} bias, \textbf{gender} bias, etc. 

To put things into perspective, one infamous example is when Microsofts AI chatbot has picked up a racist rhetoric from large racially biased data\footnote{\url{https://futurism.com/delphi-ai-ethics-racist}}. Another example is when large pretrained language models exhibit stereotypical bias. Large language models are often used to generate text and such a biased model can then generate statements that contain social stereotypes \cite{nadeem2021stereoset}.

Nowadays, these systems are used for making decisions in essential areas such as in hiring process, loans, and even justice. Therefore, a detection of possible unfairness of \Gls{ml} models and subsequent mitigation of such biases has been broadly studied \cite{blodgett2020language}.

However, besides the study of the models that reflect the biased nature of the data, one can focus on the origin of the bias introduced by the human in the first place.
Whether its a presence of gender bias,stereotypical or subjective writing this 
Biased writing, especially in the news, can have a significant influence on people who consume it. In this work, I define bias as an authors tendency, slant or implicit belief that is reflected in their writing. In terms of news media, this is called \textbf{media bias} and in this work I focus on the detection of this kind of bias.

\newpage
\subsection{Media Bias}
The need for addressing bias in media emerges from currently ever increasing social polarization. News that exhibit \textbf{media bias} can sway opinions and alter reader beliefs. In this work I refer to Allsides\footnote{\url{https://www.allsides.com/} is a company that focuses on non-automatic classification of news outlets with respect to their bias} definition of media bias:

\vbox{
\blockquote{
\textbf{Media Bias}\footnote{\url{https://www.allsides.com/blog/what-media-bias}} - \textit{noun}. The tendency of news media to report in a way that reinforces a viewpoint, worldview, preference, political ideology, corporate or financial interests, moral framework, or policy inclination, instead of reporting in an objective way (simply desricing the facts). A media outlet may reveal bias in how it reports specific news stories or which stories they choose to cover, ie., deem more important than others to cover or emphasize.
}}

Yet, the presence of media bias does not always imply a malicious intend. It is in human nature to draw on experience, thus one can simply not be aware of their implicit bias. As the authors of Allsides state, it might be even desirable. As my later experiments show, the \textit{\textbf{Commentary}} article often contains more bias, but it is its purpose to put forward an opinion. Trouble begins when a reader is not aware of it.

The media bias can be decomposed to several features\footnote{\url{https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/how-to-spot-types-of-media-bias}}. To name a few:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sensationalism/Emotionalism} - Explicit sentiment in statement
    \item \textbf{Subjective Qualifying Adjectives} - Adjectives like \textit{extreme, awkward, serious,..}
    \item \textbf{Mudslinging/Ad Hominem} - Personal attacks, insulting, degrading
\end{itemize}

The diversity of these features shows how complex and subtle overall bias information can be. On the other hand, there are other features that are practically not possible to detect automatically or would require different approaches, eg., bias by ommiting information, where a statement bias strongly depends on an outter context.


\section{Problem definition}
In this work, I focus on the automatic binary classification of the presence of media bias in statements (sentences), using state-of-the-art language models. Gathering all resources feasible for Czech language, training, Czech models and evaluation on Czech news corpora. I also aim to kickstart the research of media bias in Czech environment and present several future research propositions.
\section{My contribution}
\section{Outline}
Before I turned all of my attention to media bias detection, I have researched the possibilities of gender bias detection. Hence, I dedicate a small section to my results, an examination of one gender-focused dataset, and potential use cases.
