\section{Outline and problem definition}
There are potentially several ways of defining news text classification as \gls{nlp} problem.
In this work, I focus on automatic \textbf{binary classification} of \textbf{media bias}, on a statement level (sentence), in the Czech language.

To do so, I firstly research and gather all useful data and use machine translation to create their parallel \textbf{Czech} versions. Furthermore I presnent one, automatically created \textbf{new} Czech dataset. 

Then, using state-of-the-art language models, I experiment with different dataset settings and train a Czech \gls{mb} classifier. To evaluate the results, a gold standard dataset from \gls{mbg}\footnote{\url{https://media-bias-research.org}} is selected as a target dataset. The work of \gls{mbg} has been a great inspiration for the application of \gls{mb} detection to Czech news and I follow their methodology of using transformer models for \gls{mb} sentence classification. Furthermore, future collaboration on \gls{mb} detection research has been established.

Finally, a trained classifier is applied to provided Czech news corpora, and the results of the real-world \gls{mb} classification are presented.

Before turning my attention to media bias, I have examined several other relevant bias detection topics. At the beginning of my research, I studied the possibilities of applying gender bias detection to Czech News. Therefore, I dedicate a small section \ref{gender} to my results and examination of one of the gender-focused datasets.
